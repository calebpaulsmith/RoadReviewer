# RoadReviewer

A FEMA Public Assistance road-review toolkit. Replaces and consolidates two
prototype workbooks (`GPS Checker - TN updated 3.5.2026.xlsm` and
`Site Inspector Tool 1.xlsm`, now in `archive/`) into polished, macro-driven
Excel workbooks that staff can actually use without training.

> Historical narrative (prototype autopsy, build increments 1-6, the web
> tool's design story, PR #21-#32 play-by-play) lives in **`docs/HISTORY.md`**
> — consult it for archaeology; nothing there governs the current build.

**Two products are built from one shared `src/` tree** (split decided
2026-07-05; see §7c for the full design):

1. **`RoadReviewer.xlsm`** (standard) — for PDMGs, state/local partners and
   project reviewers. Road classification + photo-source links only; three
   sheets (Start Here / Sites / Sources); inputs are just State, an optional
   Output Folder (blank = next to the workbook) and an optional AGOL webmap
   URL. "Pick the state, paste lat/lon, click Check Roads."
2. **`Site Inspector Review Tool.xlsm`** (inspector) — everything the
   standard product does plus WO/DI/Disaster/Applicant job stamping, batch
   FIRMette download, MapPages and the combined-map PDF. Same three-sheet
   shape.

Target users: FEMA PA staff and partners, most of whom will not use anything
complicated. Target platform: Excel on a hardened government-issued Windows
laptop. No add-ins, no PowerShell, no admin rights — only what is already
installed.

---

## 1. Goal and scope

Three primary activities, each its own workflow with its own entry point but
all reading from one shared Sites table:

1. **Road classification review** — for a point, look up the FHWA functional
   class and whether it falls inside an Adjusted Census Urban Boundary
   (ACUB 2020). Tag anything that is Urban Minor Collector or greater as
   a *federal-aid road*; everything else as *non-federal aid*. The tool
   classifies the road, never the project — the inspector decides what
   federal-aid status means for any given work order.
2. **Pre-disaster imagery review** — open a point in multiple publicly
   available imagery sources (Google, Bing, FEMA Map Viewer, Google Earth,
   Street View, historic imagery where available) so the inspector can
   assess pre-disaster condition.
3. **Firmette & map production** — batch-download FEMA FIRMettes for each
   point and produce per-site location-map pages (with WO/DI/Applicant
   textbox overlays) that can be exported individually or combined.

V2 bonus (deferred): integrate with the existing route-optimization planner
in the other repo.

---

## 2. Existing prototypes — summary

The two prototype workbooks (`GPS Checker - TN updated 3.5.2026.xlsm`,
`Site Inspector Tool 1.xlsm`) now live in `archive/` as read-only references.
Their full autopsy (sheet/column maps, VBA module inventories, findings) is in
`docs/HISTORY.md` §2. The absorbed lessons: one shared Sites table; hyperlink
formulas off lat/lon; Setup named ranges for job-wide values; the FIRMette
submitJob→poll→OutputFile flow; per-row status columns; red-flag rule for
federal-aid classes; and never write to ActiveSheet — hard-bind every sheet.

---

## 3. Requirements for V1

### 3.1 Functional

- **F1. One workbook** ~~A single `.xlsm` is the deliverable~~ —
  **superseded 2026-07-05 (§7c): two workbooks are now built from the one
  shared `src/` tree** (`RoadReviewer.xlsm` standard + `Site Inspector
  Review Tool.xlsm` inspector), each with the same three-sheet shape
  (Start Here / Sites / Sources) and one shared Sites table.
- **F2. Single source of truth.** All workflows read from one `Sites`
  table on one sheet. The user enters address *or* lat/lon once and never
  retypes it.
- **F3. Three workflows on three sheets**, each with its own clearly
  labelled Start button on a `Home` sheet:
  1. **Classify Roads** — queries the per-state NFC layer + the nationwide
     ACUB layer, writes class / urban-area / eligibility flag back to the
     Sites table.
  2. **Review Imagery** — for the selected row(s), a single button opens
     a curated set of imagery URLs (Google Maps, Google Street View, Bing
     Aerial/Bird's-Eye, FEMA Map Viewer, Esri World Imagery) in default-
     browser tabs.
  3. **Produce Maps & FIRMettes** — batch FIRMette download + map-page
     PDF production (combined or per-site). **MapPages keeps the manual
     screenshot-paste flow in V1**; auto-basemap-capture moves to V2.
- **F4. Address + lat/lon input.** The Sites table accepts either. Empty
  lat/lon with a street address triggers a geocode pass (Census Bureau
  Geocoder — free, no auth, US-only) that fills lat/lon on the row. A
  Geocode Status column shows pass/fail per row. *Lat/lon already in the
  row is never overwritten by the geocoder.*
- **F5. All six Region V states wired for road classification.**
  Hard-code each state's own NFC layer(s) for class + road name (MDOT for
  MI, INDOT/IndianaMap for IN, WisDOT for WI — WI queries a local-roads
  layer first and falls back to a state-trunk layer). **MN / IL / OH were
  wired in PR #36** (§4.2c-e): all three publish a bare FHWA 1-7 code,
  Indiana-shaped, no active/retired filter. *(See*
  [§4 Data sources](#4-data-sources) *.)*
- **F6. ACUB is nationwide.** Use the user-provided AGOL nationwide ACUB
  feature service for all six Region V states (see §4.2). One lookup
  call per row, regardless of state.
- **F7. Federal-aid rule.** A row is tagged as a *federal-aid road* if
  any intersecting (or nearest-within-150-ft) road segment has a
  functional class of **Urban Minor Collector or greater** inside the
  relevant urban boundary. The tool tags the road, not the project —
  no "eligible"/"ineligible" language anywhere in the output. The
  inspector decides what federal-aid status means for the work order.
  Implementation:
  - Query the state's NFC layer for class + road name.
  - Cross-check the point against the ACUB polygon layer to determine
    Urban vs Rural.
  - Non-federal-aid classes: Rural Local, Rural Minor Collector,
    Urban Local. Federal-aid: Urban Minor Collector or higher.
  - The Federal Aid Status column shows "Federal aid - <class>",
    "Non-federal aid - <class>", or "Review - <reason>". The Sites
    table tints each row light red, green, or yellow accordingly. The
    KML export uses red / green / yellow pushpins for the same three
    buckets; rows that haven't been classified get the default pin.
  - **Always run, on every row.** V1 has no visibility into the row's
    PA work Category, so we run eligibility on everything regardless of
    work type. If the tool later integrates with Grants Manager
    (V2+), it could narrow the check to categories where road class
    actually matters — primarily Cat B (Emergency Protective Measures)
    and Cat C (Roads & Bridges), with Cat D (Water Control Facilities),
    Cat F (Public Utilities), and Cat G (Parks/Rec/Other) sometimes
    also touching federal-aid routes.
- **F8. State selector.** The State dropdown offers all six Region V
  states (WI / IN / MI / MN / IL / OH), every one wired for NFC lookup
  since PR #36. A TYPED out-of-region code (e.g. TN) still pops the
  "NFC lookup not yet wired — ACUB still runs" message and continues
  ACUB-only. A BLANK State refuses to classify: every target row gets
  "Failed - no State selected" plus a prompt pointing at the State box
  (blank used to silently mean Michigan — removed in PR #36).
- **F9. NHS column.** Dropped from V1 per user direction. Re-add if
  needed in a later version.
- **F10. Single export across all points.** Provide:
  - One combined Map PDF (already exists — extend it).
  - One KML with all points (already exists).
  - One CSV/XLSX export of the Sites table including all lookup results,
    suitable for handing off to a reviewer.
- **F11. Per-row "Open in map" link.** Every row has a hyperlink that
  drops the user on that exact point in the state's NFC/NHS/ACUB
  Experience app (preserves the prototype's pattern of one click → one
  point).
- **F12. Re-run failed rows only.** A button that re-attempts only rows
  whose status column says "Failed - …".
- **F13. Status panel.** A Status column shows live progress during long
  runs (Application.StatusBar → "Downloading 7 of 42 — Site …"). Already
  present, keep it.
- **F14. WO/DI is per-job.** WO/DI live on the Setup sheet only; the
  inspector can override a single row by manually typing into the row's
  WO/DI cells (always shown, never hidden). No mode toggle.

### 3.2 Non-functional

- **N1. Zero external dependencies** beyond what ships with Office on a
  Windows 10/11 govt laptop. Specifically OK to use:
  `MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0`, `ADODB.Stream`, `VBScript.RegExp`,
  `Scripting.FileSystemObject`, `MSForms.DataObject` (via CLSID),
  `Shell` to launch `explorer.exe` / `cmd /c start`.
- **N2. No PowerShell, no add-ins, no installs.** PowerShell is permitted
  *as a last resort* for things the macro cannot do, but the user prefers
  to avoid it.
- **N3. Trust prompts.** The workbook will be opened from
  `OneDrive - FEMA` or SharePoint paths. We need to document how to
  unblock the macro (`Unblock-File` may not be available; right-click →
  Properties → Unblock is the documented path) and we need a one-pager
  for users.
- **N4. Polished.** Consistent column constants, named ranges, defined
  buttons with sensible labels, no orphan macros, no developer artefacts
  (e.g. `Debug.Print`), no commented-out code.
- **N5. Reproducible.** Each workflow can be re-run safely (idempotent
  output: clearing the row's lookup columns before writing new values).
- **N6. Recursive manual verification.** See [§5 Verification plan](#5-verification-plan)
  — each step has an explicit smoke test before we move on.

### 3.3 Out of scope for V1

- MN / IL / OH road-classification queries.
- Address geocoding *(see open question — may move into V1)*.
- Route-optimization integration (V2).
- Embedding ArcGIS-native widgets in Excel.
- Automated screenshot capture from third-party basemaps.
- Authentication to AGOL services.

---

## 4. Data sources

### 4.1 FEMA FIRMette Print service *(unchanged from prototype)*

- Base: `https://msc.fema.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NFHL_Print/MSCPrintB/GPServer/PrintFIRMette`
- Flow: `submitJob?input_lat=…&input_lon=…&Print_Type=FIRMETTE&graphic=PDF&f=pjson`
  → poll `jobs/{jobId}?f=pjson` until `esriJobSucceeded` → fetch
  `jobs/{jobId}/results/OutputFile?f=pjson` → download `url` as PDF.

### 4.2 Michigan road classification (V1)

Source app: MDOT's "NFC, NHS & ACUB" Experience at
<https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7edd160c205d46b481fcd605bb4c58ce/page/NFC%2C-NHS-%26-ACUB>.
The Experience config itself is not directly fetchable, but the underlying
REST services are publicly readable. Field names and the
`FunctionalSystem` coded-value domain below were confirmed against the
live `?f=pjson` metadata on 2026-05-22 (verification step §5.1).

**Operational note — MDOT requires a browser User-Agent.** Hitting any
`mdotgis.state.mi.us/arcgis/...` endpoint with the default
`MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP` UA returns HTTP 403. The VBA HTTP helper must set
a UA header that looks like a browser
(e.g. `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 …`)
before calling `send`. The NTAD ACUB service (§4.2 ACUB block) has no
such requirement.

#### NFC — National Functional Classification (polyline)

The class code, the road's PR (route identifier) and the route designation
are split across **three companion layers** on the same FeatureServer,
all keyed by `PR` + `PRBmp`/`PREmp` (Michigan's LRS — Physical Reference
+ Begin/End Milepost).

##### Layer 353 — `Functional System` (the class code lives here)

- URL: `https://mdotgis.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/Widget/NextGenPrFinderPub/FeatureServer/353`
- Type: `Feature Layer` (esriGeometryPolyline)
- Spatial reference: WKID 3078 / latestWkid 102123 (Michigan GeoRef).
  Hand it WGS84 with `inSR=4326`.
- displayField: `EventId`
- Confirmed fields (name / type / alias):

  | name | type | alias |
  |---|---|---|
  | `OBJECTID` | esriFieldTypeOID | OBJECTID |
  | `EventId` | esriFieldTypeString | Event ID |
  | `PR` | esriFieldTypeString | PR |
  | `PRBmp` | esriFieldTypeDouble | PR BMP |
  | `PREmp` | esriFieldTypeDouble | PR EMP |
  | `FunctionalSystem` | esriFieldTypeSmallInteger | Functional System |
  | `ProposedFunctionalSystem` | esriFieldTypeSmallInteger | Proposed Functional System |
  | `FieldEstablishDate` | esriFieldTypeDate | Field Establish Date |
  | `RHEstablishDate` | esriFieldTypeDate | RH Establish Date |
  | `RHRetireDate` | esriFieldTypeDate | RH Retire Date |
  | `SystemCreateDate` | esriFieldTypeDate | System Create Date |
  | `SystemModifiedDate` | esriFieldTypeDate | System Modified Date |
  | `UserCreate` | esriFieldTypeString | User Create |
  | `UserModified` | esriFieldTypeString | User Modified |
  | `LocationError` | esriFieldTypeString | Location Error |
  | `Shape__Length` | esriFieldTypeDouble | Shape.STLength() |
  | `GlobalID` | esriFieldTypeGlobalID | GlobalID |
  | `VALIDATIONSTATUS` | esriFieldTypeSmallInteger | Validation status |

- **`FunctionalSystem` coded-value domain** (`LrseFunctionalSystem`):

  | code | name |
  |---|---|
  | 0 | Non-Certified Roadway |
  | 1 | Interstate |
  | 2 | Other Freeway |
  | 3 | Other Principal Arterial |
  | 4 | Minor Arterial |
  | 5 | Major Collector |
  | 6 | Minor Collector |
  | 7 | Local |

  Note: this is the *bare FHWA class code* — it does **not** carry the
  Urban/Rural prefix (unlike the TDOT prototype). Urban vs Rural is
  determined exclusively by the ACUB point-in-polygon check (below).

- **Retired-segment filter is mandatory.** Several intersecting segments
  at any given point can have non-null `RHRetireDate`. Production queries
  must filter `where=RHRetireDate IS NULL` or risk reading historical
  classifications.

##### Layer 364 — `Classification` (feature-type code, e.g. "RD")

- URL: `https://mdotgis.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/Widget/NextGenPrFinderPub/FeatureServer/364`
- Type: `Feature Layer` (polyline), WKID 3078/102123
- displayField: `FeatureClassificationCode`
- Confirmed fields: `OBJECTID`, `EventId`, `PR`, `PRBmp`, `PREmp`,
  `FeatureClassificationCode` (string — at every Detroit/Kalamazoo
  sample point this returned `"RD"`, i.e. "Road"; this layer
  classifies the *kind of feature* — Road vs Trail vs Ramp — not the
  FHWA class), `RHEstablishDate`, `RHRetireDate`, `SystemCreateDate`,
  `SystemModifiedDate`, `UserCreate`, `UserModified`, `LocationError`,
  `Shape__Length`, `GlobalID`. No coded-value domains.
- **Use in V1: skip.** The FHWA class comes from 353 and 364 does not
  carry the urban/rural flag we hoped it might. Keep this URL on file
  for future filtering (e.g. excluding non-road LRS features), but the
  V1 eligibility logic doesn't need it.

##### Layer 543 — `Route System` (route designation = road name source)

- URL: `https://mdotgis.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/Widget/NextGenPrFinderPub/FeatureServer/543`
- Type: `Feature Layer` (polyline), WKID 3078/102123
- displayField: `EventId`
- Confirmed fields: `OBJECTID`, `GlobalID`, `EventId`, `PR`, `PRBmp`,
  `PREmp`, plus three repeats of the route-name tuple:
  - `RouteDesignation`, `RouteNumber`, `RouteBRBLBS`, `RouteBranch`
  - `RouteDesignation2`, `RouteNumber2`, `RouteBRBLBS2`, `RouteBranch2`
  - `RouteDesignation3`, `RouteNumber3`, `RouteBRBLBS3`, `RouteBranch3`

  (plus the standard `RHEstablishDate`/`RHRetireDate`/audit fields).
- **Caveat — only designated trunkline routes are populated.** A
  point-in-polyline (with 150-ft buffer) at downtown Detroit
  (lon=-83.045, lat=42.331) returned **0 features** from layer 543:
  Woodward / Larned / etc. are local streets without an Interstate / US
  / M route designation. The road *name* the inspector cares about
  ("Larned St", "Holmes Rd") is not present in layer 543.
- **Implication for V1.** We get the FHWA class from 353 and the
  *trunkline route name* from 543 when present (e.g. "I-94 BL"). When
  543 returns nothing, the Road Name column will be blank for that row.
  A future enhancement can reverse-geocode the road name from the
  Census Bureau or an OSM source. (Logged for V2 — see §6.)

#### NHS — National Highway System (polyline)

- FeatureServer: `https://mdotgis.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/Widget/NextGenPrFinderPub/FeatureServer/333`
- Layer name: `Nhs`. Key field also called `Nhs` (unique-value renderer).
- Spatial reference: WKID 102123.
- Sample query: `https://mdotgis.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/Widget/NextGenPrFinderPub/FeatureServer/333/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&resultRecordCount=1&f=json`

#### ACUB — Adjusted Census Urban Boundary (polygon)

**V1 source: USDOT NTAD "Adjusted Urban Areas" (2020) — nationwide.**
The layer is published as AGOL item `decb7d40c3d540f484dc6925effa9d4b`
("2020 Adjusted Urban Area Boundaries") via UDOT's UPLAN portal, which
re-hosts the USDOT BTS NTAD dataset. **User confirmed nationwide coverage**
visually in the ArcGIS Map Viewer
(`https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=decb7d40c3d540f484dc6925effa9d4b`).
A prior research pass briefly mis-flagged this as Utah-only based on the
host portal name; that inference was wrong.

- **FeatureServer (user-verified):** `https://services.arcgis.com/xOi1kZaI0eWDREZv/arcgis/rest/services/NTAD_Adjusted_Urban_Areas/FeatureServer/0`
- Metadata (run from a workstation that can reach `services.arcgis.com`):
  `https://services.arcgis.com/xOi1kZaI0eWDREZv/arcgis/rest/services/NTAD_Adjusted_Urban_Areas/FeatureServer/0?f=pjson`
- Sample point-in-polygon query (Detroit, used in verification step §5.1):
  `https://services.arcgis.com/xOi1kZaI0eWDREZv/arcgis/rest/services/NTAD_Adjusted_Urban_Areas/FeatureServer/0/query?geometry=-83.045,42.331&geometryType=esriGeometryPoint&inSR=4326&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&outFields=*&returnGeometry=false&f=json`
- Hub page (download + schema + sample queries): `https://data-uplan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/uplan::2020-adjusted-urban-area-boundaries/about`.
- Type: `Feature Layer` (polygon), spatial reference WKID 4326 (native
  WGS84 — no reprojection needed).
- displayField: `NAME`
- **Confirmed fields** (verification step §5.1, 2026-05-22):

  | name | type | alias |
  |---|---|---|
  | `OBJECTID` | esriFieldTypeOID | OBJECTID |
  | `AREA` | esriFieldTypeDouble | AREA |
  | `UACE` | esriFieldTypeString | UACE |
  | `NAME` | esriFieldTypeString | NAME |
  | `F2020POPUL` | esriFieldTypeDouble | F2020POPUL |
  | `F2020HOUSI` | esriFieldTypeDouble | F2020HOUSI |
  | `F2020_POPD` | esriFieldTypeDouble | F2020_POPD |
  | `state_1` | esriFieldTypeString | state_1 |
  | `Shape__Area` | esriFieldTypeDouble | Shape__Area |
  | `Shape__Length` | esriFieldTypeDouble | Shape__Length |

  No coded-value domains. The urban-area name we surface to the
  inspector lives in **`NAME`** (e.g. `"Detroit, MI"`,
  `"Ann Arbor, MI"`, `"Kalamazoo, MI"`). `UACE` is the 5-digit Census
  urban-area code (used in 2020 release; note no `20` suffix — the
  field names dropped it). `state_1` is the two-letter state
  abbreviation.

##### Fallback layers (only if the nationwide AGOL item turns out to be unreliable)

- **Michigan MapServer (2010-vintage, "v17a"):** `https://gisagocss.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/michigan_geographic_framework/MapServer/5`
  - Fields confirmed: `OBJECTID`, `ACUBCODE` (str4), `ACUBNUM` (int),
    `NAME` (str36, display name), `LABEL` (str60), `TYPE` (str4), `RU`,
    `SQKM`, `SQMILES`, `ACRES`.
  - Sample point-in-polygon query (WGS84 input): `https://gisagocss.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/michigan_geographic_framework/MapServer/5/query?geometry=-83.045,42.331&geometryType=esriGeometryPoint&inSR=4326&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&outFields=*&returnGeometry=false&f=json`
  - **Caveat:** this is the **2010-vintage** v17a layer. The FHWA-approved
    **2020 ACUB** was reportedly scheduled for MDOT database entry in 2025.
  - Alternate Michigan MapServers carrying the same / similar data:
    - `https://mdotgis.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/Widget/NextGenPrFinderPub/MapServer/282` (layer `ACUB`)
    - `http://gisp.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT/ACUB/MapServer`
- **Other nationwide candidates** (parked, not used in V1):
  - USDOT BTS NTAD "Urban Areas" — `https://geodata.bts.gov/datasets/usdot::urban-areas/about`
  - FHWA HPMS Adjusted Urban Areas (2020) — `https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/census_issues/urbanized_areas_and_mpo_tma/`
  - US Census TIGER/Line 2020 Urban Areas — `https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020/UAC/`

#### Query strategy (Michigan)

Mirroring the TDOT pattern, but with two layers instead of one:

1. **NFC query** — layer 353. Point intersect first; if no hit, fall
   back to a 150-foot distance search. Always filter
   `where=RHRetireDate IS NULL` to exclude retired segments. Read
   `FunctionalSystem` (smallint → look up label via the coded-value
   domain above) and `PR`. The road name itself is **not** carried on
   layer 353 — see step 2.
2. **Road-name query** — layer 543 with the same point-intersect /
   150-ft fallback. Concatenate any non-null
   `RouteDesignation{,2,3}` + `RouteNumber{,2,3}` tuples into a
   display string. Expect this to be **blank for local streets**
   (only trunkline routes are populated); that's fine.
3. **ACUB query** — point intersect against the NTAD polygon layer.
   If the point is inside any ACUB polygon → Urban (record `NAME`,
   `UACE`, `state_1`). Otherwise → Rural.
4. **NHS query** — V1 skips this (per F9). Layer 333 URL kept on file
   for V1.1.
5. **Federal Aid Status column** — composed from the NFC class + ACUB
   result. Non-federal aid: (Urban + Local), (Rural + Local),
   (Rural + Minor Collector). Federal aid: everything else. The
   smallint -> tag table in VBA terms:

   | `FunctionalSystem` | ACUB hit? | Result |
   |---|---|---|
   | 7 (Local) | yes (Urban) | Non-federal aid - Urban Local |
   | 7 (Local) | no (Rural) | Non-federal aid - Rural Local |
   | 6 (Minor Collector) | no (Rural) | Non-federal aid - Rural Minor Collector |
   | 6 (Minor Collector) | yes (Urban) | Federal aid - Urban Minor Collector |
   | 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1 | either | Federal aid - <Urban/Rural class> |
   | 0 (Non-Certified) | either | Review - non-certified class, check manually |

   When multiple segments are returned (intersection within 150 ft),
   the row is tagged federal-aid if *any* returned segment is.

#### Confirmed test coordinates (verification §5.1)

The following three known points were verified live against the MDOT
353 + NTAD ACUB services on 2026-05-22. Use them as the smoke-test set
for workflow 1.

| # | Expected outcome | lat | lon | NFC class | ACUB |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Federal aid** — Urban Minor Collector | `42.28536` | `-85.57025` | `6` (Minor Collector), single segment, PR=`0006904` | `Kalamazoo, MI` (UACE=`43723`) |
| 2 | Non-federal aid — Urban Local | `42.6911` | `-84.5360` | `7` (Local), single segment, PR=`0343402` (Holmes Rd corridor) | `Lansing, MI` (UACE=`47719`) |
| 3 | Non-federal aid — Rural Local | `44.2700` | `-83.5200` | `7` (Local), single segment, PR=`1257508` (Iosco County, near Tawas City) | none — point is rural |

Note on §5 step 1's third bullet ("Rural Local inside an ACUB"): a
class-7 polyline that intersects an ACUB polygon is by definition
*Urban* Local under the eligibility rule, not Rural Local. The intent
is "a class-7 (Local) road inside an ACUB" — that's test case #2
above.

### 4.2a Indiana road classification (V1)

Source (updated 2026-07-16, test 7.16): the **authoritative INDOT
Roads_and_Highways collaboration service** on `gis.indot.in.gov/ro` — the
exact layer that backs INDOT's official "INDOT Functional Class Map"
Experience (`APP_IN`, item `e388c2aa14aa4788a702705620567589`, owner
`MMcMahan@indot.IN.gov`). The tool previously read the `gisdata.in.gov`
open-data mirror; that copy is staler (148,185 vs 153,740 segments live) and
was missing/mis-filtering local roads the official map shows. Confirmed live
2026-07-16.

#### Layer `LRSE_Functional_Class` — the class code

- URL: `https://gis.indot.in.gov/ro/rest/services/RAH_GIO_Collaboration/LRSE_Functional_Class/FeatureServer/22`
- Type: `Feature Layer` (esriGeometryPolyline), native WKID 26916 (NAD83 UTM
  16N). Hand it WGS84 with `inSR=4326`, same pattern as MDOT. Capabilities:
  `Query,Sync,ChangeTracking` (anonymous read OK).
- **Field names are UPPERCASE on this service** (ArcGIS JSON keys are
  case-sensitive, §9.3): `FROM_DATE`, `TO_DATE`, `EVENT_ID`, `ROUTE_ID`,
  `FROM_MEASURE`/`TO_MEASURE`, `RECORD_STATUS` (SmallInteger),
  **`FUNCTIONAL_CLASS`** (SmallInteger), audit fields, `OBJECTID`,
  `GLOBALID`, `Shape__Length`. (The old gisdata mirror used lowercase
  `functional_class`/`record_status`.)
- **`FUNCTIONAL_CLASS` values** — bare FHWA 1-7, same numbering as MDOT, no
  urban/rural embedded:

  | code | name |
  |---|---|
  | 1 | Interstate |
  | 2 | Principal Arterial - Other Freeways/Expressways |
  | 3 | Principal Arterial - Other |
  | 4 | Minor Arterial |
  | 5 | Major Collector |
  | 6 | Minor Collector |
  | 7 | Local |

- **No record-status filter — query `where=1=1`.** This authoritative layer
  contains only `RECORD_STATUS` values **{1, 4, 5, null}** (distinct values,
  live) — *no* retired/replaced/withdrawn segments — and INDOT's own
  Experience applies no status filter, so `1=1` matches the official map.
  The former `record_status=5` (Active) filter silently dropped **16,830
  valid null-status segments** — e.g. Wolf Run Rd (a class-5 Major Collector
  at 87 ft, test-7.16 site 8) reported "no road found" purely because its
  segment carried `RECORD_STATUS=null`. Do not reintroduce the filter.
- **Genuinely unclassified roads still return zero segments.** Some local
  roads (e.g. test-7.16 site 10, Mohawk Trail) are simply absent from INDOT's
  functional-class layer even on the authoritative service — they carry no
  FHWA class. When the class query returns nothing *but* a named road was
  found nearby (state name layer or Census TIGER), the verdict is
  **"Review - road not classified"** (reason "Unclassified road") rather than
  "no road found", so the inspector sees the road exists but INDOT assigns it
  no class (`modClassify.ComputeVerdict`).

#### Layer `Road_Centerlines_of_Indiana_2021` — road name (separate, un-keyed)

- URL: `https://gisdata.in.gov/server/rest/services/Hosted/Road_Centerlines_of_Indiana_2021/FeatureServer/15`
- Type: `Feature Layer` (esriGeometryPolyline), WKID 26916, displayField
  `st_name`.
- Confirmed fields: `st_name`, **`st_full`** (best display value, e.g.
  `"MERIDIAN ST"` — this is what RoadReviewer reads), directional/type
  modifier components, and a `roadclass` string field (returned null in
  every sample — not reliable, not used).
- **This layer is not LRS-keyed to `LRSE_Functional_Class`** — there is
  no shared join field, unlike MDOT where 353/543 both key off
  `PR`/`PRBmp`/`PREmp`. Road name is resolved via a fully separate
  point-intersect query (same exact-point-then-150-ft-buffer pattern).
  Indiana's functional-class layer carries no name field at all — not
  even a trunkline-only one like MDOT 543 — so this comes back blank
  more often than Michigan's Road Name column; Census TIGER (already
  wired for every state) backs it up.

Road name is still resolved from the `gisdata.in.gov` centerlines layer
(field `st_full`, lowercase — unchanged by the RO switch); INDOT's
functional-class layer carries no name field, so names come back blank more
often than Michigan's and Census TIGER (wired for every state) backs it up.
Because the state centerlines return ALL-CAPS names (`MERIDIAN ST`) and TIGER
returns title-case (`N Meridian St`), the two used to appear as separate
"roads" in the Road Name column; `FormatRoadList`/`NormalizeRoadKey` now
collapse them (strip a leading/trailing compass token, canonicalize the
street-type suffix, prefer the mixed-case display) so one physical road reads
once (test-7.16 request 3).

#### UA / header quirks

None observed. Both `gis.indot.in.gov` and `gisdata.in.gov` answer plain
`f=json` GETs without a browser User-Agent (unlike `mdotgis.state.mi.us`).
RoadReviewer sends the browser UA on every request regardless
(`modHttp.HttpGetText`), which is harmless here.

#### Confirmed test coordinates (verified live 2026-07-16 against the RO layer)

| # | Expected outcome | lat | lon | `FUNCTIONAL_CLASS` (closest) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Federal aid - Urban Minor Collector | `39.7684` | `-86.1581` | `6` (Minor Collector) @152 ft, downtown Indianapolis / Monument Circle; ACUB `Indianapolis, IN` |
| 2 | Federal aid - Rural Other Principal Arterial | `39.4234` | `-86.7628` | `3` (Principal Arterial - Other) @102 ft, near Martinsville |
| 3 | Non-federal aid - Urban Local | `39.9876` | `-86.0128` | `7` (Local) @89 ft, Marion/Hamilton county line inside the `Indianapolis, IN` ACUB |
| 8 | Federal aid - Rural Major Collector | `38.792119` | `-85.293851` | `5` (Major Collector) @87 ft, Wolf Run Rd — `RECORD_STATUS=null`, so the old `record_status=5` filter reported "no road found" |
| 10 | Review - road not classified | `39.402683` | `-85.302633` | *(no INDOT segment)* — Mohawk Trail present in TIGER (83 ft) but unclassified by INDOT |

### 4.2b Wisconsin road classification (V1)

Source: two companion AGOL-hosted feature services owned by WisDOT
(`services5.arcgis.com`, account `wisnipsvki_WisDOT`), both explicitly
built for damage-assessment use — confirmed live 2026-07-01. Same
hosting pattern as the nationwide NTAD ACUB layer (§4.2), not a
state-hosted server like MDOT's — so no browser-UA workaround needed.

Wisconsin is the only wired state that needs **two layers queried in
sequence**: the Local Road Network layer covers county/municipal/town
roads *and most collectors* (the large majority of points) but encodes
urban/rural into its own class code instead of carrying a bare FHWA
number; the State Trunk Network covers interstates/state highways with a
clean bare FHWA code.

**Query order (updated — PR "WI layer swap", 2026-07-10): local FIRST,
trunk as fallback.** Per user direction, the Local Road Network layer is
queried first because it carries most points; the State Trunk Network is
consulted only when the local layer has no usable class for the point.
This reverses the earlier trunk-first order. See "Query strategy" below
for the stub-detection detail that keeps state highways correct.

**Link change (same PR): WisDOT moved/locked the old local-roads
service.** The previous `WI_Local_Roads_Flood_Damage_Assessment_Snapshot`
now returns `{"error":{"code":499,"message":"Token Required"}}`; the live
public local layer is `Functional_Class_Local_Non_Prod/1` (same schema,
same account, same fields). The state-trunk `FFCL_gdb/3` was unchanged.
Both URLs are now **overridable at runtime** without a rebuild — paste a
replacement into the Sources sheet's "Service URLs" table (Excel named
range `Svc_WI_LOCAL_ROADS`), the web tool's "Data service URLs" panel, or
the notebook's `SERVICE_OVERRIDES` dict (see "Service-URL overrides"
below).

#### Layer `FFCL_gdb/3` — State Trunk Network (fallback; state highways/interstates)

- URL: `https://services5.arcgis.com/0pgGLzT0Nh7FVjon/arcgis/rest/services/FFCL_gdb/FeatureServer/3`
  ("Extract of the Functional Class - State Trunk Network for IDA
  Application")
- Type: `Feature Layer` (esriGeometryPolyline), spatial reference WKID
  102100/3857 (Web Mercator). Hand it WGS84 with `inSR=4326`; the
  service reprojects automatically.
- Confirmed fields: `OBJECTID`, `FED_FUNC_CLS_ID`, `RWLK_ID`, `FC_CD`
  (WisDOT's own internal code), `FC_ABBR_DESC`, `FC_DESC`,
  `LAST_CHANGED_BY`, `LAST_CHANGED_ON`, **`FED_FC_CD`** (String — bare
  FHWA class code, `"1"`–`"7"`), `URB_TYPE` (String: `"Urban"` /
  `"Rural"` / null — **not used**; RoadReviewer keeps ACUB as the single
  urban/rural source of truth for every state, per §4.2), `FED_FC_DESC`,
  `FC_TYPE`, **`HWYTYPE`** (STH/USH/IH/OFF), **`HWYNUM`**, **`HWYDIR`**,
  `SEGLEN`, `DIV_STATUS`, `FROM_OFFSET`, `TO_OFFSET`, `Shape__Length`.
- **`FED_FC_CD` values (confirmed live via `returnDistinctValues=true`)**
  — standard FHWA 1-7, identical numbering to Michigan and Indiana:

  | FED_FC_CD | FED_FC_DESC |
  |---|---|
  | 1 | Principal Arterial - Interstate |
  | 2 | Principal Arterial - Freeways and Expressways |
  | 3 | Principal Arterial - Other |
  | 4 | Minor Arterial |
  | 5 | Major Collector |
  | 6 | Minor Collector |
  | 7 | Local |
  | *(null)* | unclassified / off-network (ramps, etc.) |

- Road name is built from `HWYTYPE` + `HWYNUM` + `HWYDIR` (e.g. `"STH 32
  S"`, `"USH 18 E"`).
- No retired-segment filter needed — this is described as a point-in-time
  snapshot/extract service (no version/retire-date field in the schema),
  unlike MDOT's editable production layer.

#### Layer `Functional_Class_Local_Non_Prod/1` — Local Road Network (queried FIRST; local roads + most collectors)

- URL: `https://services5.arcgis.com/0pgGLzT0Nh7FVjon/arcgis/rest/services/Functional_Class_Local_Non_Prod/FeatureServer/1`
  (name "Functional Class - Wisconsin Local Road Network"; replaced the
  token-gated `WI_Local_Roads_Flood_Damage_Assessment_Snapshot/1`,
  confirmed live 2026-07-10).
- Type: `Feature Layer` (esriGeometryPolyline), Web Mercator (`inSR=4326`
  reprojects). Same WISLR-derived ~97-field schema as WisDOT's
  general-purpose `WISLR_Functional_Road_Classification` hosted layer,
  filtered to the local-road network. **State highways also appear here
  but with a null (or `0`) `FNCT_CLS_CTGY_TYCD` — an unclassified "stub."**
  The classifier skips those stubs for class/name AND treats their
  presence as the trigger to also query the State Trunk layer (so a point
  on a state highway is still classified). Confirmed live 2026-07-10: at
  Milwaukee the layer returns `E Wisconsin Ave` (code 60) alongside a
  null-class `'18'` stub; at STH 52 Rhinelander it returns only `'52'`
  stubs (no real local class → fall through to trunk).
- Relevant fields: **`ST_LABL_NM`** (road name — populated for local
  streets, better coverage here than MDOT's trunkline-only layer 543),
  `FNCT_CLS_TYCD` / **`FNCT_CLS_CTGY_TYCD`** (WisDOT's own class scheme —
  see domain below), `FEDUA_TYCD` (3-digit urban-area code, `'000'` =
  rural/no urban area, e.g. `'057'` = Milwaukee urban area — not used,
  same ACUB-is-source-of-truth reasoning as `URB_TYPE` above),
  `NHS_CLS_TYCD` (`'NHS'`/`'NON'` — unused, NHS is out of scope per F9).
- **`FNCT_CLS_CTGY_TYCD` domain** — confirmed live via the layer's
  renderer `uniqueValueInfos` (no formal coded-value domain is published
  in the service metadata, so this was read off the map-symbology
  config instead):

  | value | label |
  |---|---|
  | 10 | Rural Principal Arterial |
  | 60 | Urban Principal Arterial |
  | 20 | Rural Minor Arterial |
  | 86 | Urban Minor Arterial Other |
  | 30 | Rural Major Collector |
  | 96 | Urban Collector Other |
  | 40 | Rural Minor Collector |
  | 45 | Rural Local |
  | 97 | Urban Local |

  Unlike the state-trunk layer's `FED_FC_CD`, **this field embeds
  urban/rural directly into the code** (like Tennessee's `FUNC_CLASS` in
  the prototype) instead of carrying a bare FHWA number.
  `WisconsinLocalCategoryToFhwa()` in `modConstants.bas` strips the
  urban/rural digit back out to a bare FHWA 1-7 code before this feeds
  into the shared `FederalAidVerdict()` logic. One quirk: `96` ("Urban
  Collector Other") doesn't distinguish Major from Minor Collector.
  That split only changes the federal-aid verdict for *rural* collectors
  (rural major = federal aid, rural minor = not) — every *urban*
  collector is federal aid regardless of major/minor (§4.2's eligibility
  table), so mapping `96` to Major Collector (5) is safe either way and
  never produces a wrong verdict.
- No retired-segment filter needed (same "point-in-time snapshot" pattern
  as the state-trunk layer).

#### Query strategy (Wisconsin) — local-first (PR "WI layer swap")

1. Point-intersect (then configured-buffer fallback) against
   `Functional_Class_Local_Non_Prod/1` **first** (one query returns both
   `FNCT_CLS_CTGY_TYCD` and `ST_LABL_NM`, halving the hit count on this
   layer). For each returned feature: if `FNCT_CLS_CTGY_TYCD` decodes
   (via `WisconsinLocalCategoryToFhwa()`) to a real FHWA class ≥ 1, keep
   the segment + name; if it is null or decodes to `0` (a state-highway
   stub), skip it and set `sawStub`.
2. Query `FFCL_gdb/3` (State Trunk, bare `FED_FC_CD`) **only when** the
   local layer returned no real class **OR** `sawStub` is set (a state
   highway is present that only the trunk layer classifies). Merge its
   segments/names in with the local ones.
3. The **closest** road across whatever both layers returned drives the
   verdict (PR #24 model). Net effect: a point genuinely on a local road
   near a state highway now reads as the local road with a yellow
   "Nearby FHWA road" flag, rather than being forced to the highway's
   class (e.g. 45.4711,-89.7345 = W Wisconsin Ave 26 ft vs STH 86 199 ft).
4. ACUB (urban/rural) runs exactly as it does for every other state —
   independently of whichever WI layer answered the class query.

Rationale for local-first (per user, 2026-07-10): most damage points are
on local roads / collectors carried by the local layer, so querying it
first means one query for the common case; the trunk layer is a low-risk
fallback (it is the layer WisDOT did *not* lock down). The stub trigger
keeps the single-query optimization from ever misclassifying a state
highway that happens to sit near a local road.

#### UA / header quirks

None. Both layers are AGOL-hosted `services5.arcgis.com` feature
services — default UA (or any UA) returns 200, same as the nationwide
ACUB layer. RoadReviewer sends its browser UA on every request
regardless; harmless here.

#### Confirmed test coordinates (verified live 2026-07-01)

| # | Expected outcome | lat | lon | Layer / result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Higher-class, urban | `43.0389` | `-87.9065` | State Trunk: `FED_FC_CD='4'` (Minor Arterial), `URB_TYPE='Urban'` — E Wisconsin Ave / USH 18 / STH 32, downtown Milwaukee |
| 2 | Higher-class, rural | `45.4711` | `-89.7345` | State Trunk: `HWYTYPE='STH'`, `HWYNUM='86'`, `FED_FC_CD='5'` (Major Collector), `URB_TYPE='Rural'` — near Tomahawk, WI |
| 3 | Local road, rural | ~`46.65` | ~`-90.86` | Local Roads (state-trunk layer returns nothing here): `FNCT_CLS_CTGY_TYCD=45` (Rural Local), `FEDUA_TYCD='000'` — Ballard Rd, Washburn County |

### 4.2c Minnesota road classification (wired PR #36)

Source: MnDOT's public ArcGIS Server (`dotapp9.dot.state.mn.us`), the same
Functional Class layer MnDOT's EMMA app (`APP_MN`) displays. Schema
confirmed live 2026-07-15 via `?f=pjson` + `returnDistinctValues`.

- **Layer:** `https://dotapp9.dot.state.mn.us/egis12/rest/services/BASEMAP/mndot_commonlayers2/MapServer/11`
  ("Functional Class", esriGeometryPolyline, native WKID 26915 / NAD83 UTM
  15N — hand it WGS84 with `inSR=4326`). Classic MapServer, `capabilities:
  Query,Map,Data`.
- **Class field:** `FUNCTIONAL_CLASS` (esriFieldTypeInteger) — **bare FHWA
  1-7**, confirmed by distinct values; `FUNCTIONAL_CLASS_DESC` carries the
  matching standard label ("Principal Arterial - Interstate" … "Local").
- **No active/retired filter needed** (`where=1=1`).
- **No road-name field** — `ROUTE_ID` is an LRS key. Census TIGER backfills
  all Minnesota street names.
- **Renderer quirk (web figures):** MnDOT's published uniqueValue renderer
  keys off `FUNCTIONAL_CLASS_DESC` (the label string), not the numeric
  code — the web tool's frame query fetches both fields.
- **Test coordinates (live-verified 2026-07-15):**

  | # | Expected | lat | lon | Notes |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Federal aid - Urban Minor Arterial | `44.9531` | `-93.1668` | Snelling Ave, St Paul (class 4 @ 36 ft closest); ACUB `Minneapolis--St. Paul, MN` |
  | 2 | Non-federal aid - Urban Local | `44.9260` | `-93.2570` | Minneapolis residential, all class 7 |
  | 3 | Non-federal aid - Rural Local | `45.822764` | `-95.222414` | rural Douglas County, class 7 @ 0 ft, outside every ACUB |

### 4.2d Illinois road classification (wired PR #36)

Source: IDOT's public ArcGIS Server (`gis1.dot.illinois.gov`), the layer
behind the Getting Around Illinois RFC viewer (`APP_IL`). Confirmed live
2026-07-15.

- **Layer:** `https://gis1.dot.illinois.gov/arcgis/rest/services/AdministrativeData/FunctionalClass/MapServer/0`
  ("Functional Class", polyline, WKID 102113/3785 Web Mercator).
- **Class field:** `FC` — a **STRING** `"1"`-`"7"` with a published
  coded-value domain matching FHWA (1 Interstate (PAS) … 7 Local Road or
  Street). Read with `isStringClass=True` in `AddClassSegs`, like WI's
  `FED_FC_CD`.
- **No active/retired filter needed.**
- **No street names** — `LABEL_1`/`KEY_RT_*` are route-system inventory
  codes ("FAU 1422", "MUN 4022H"), not names. TIGER backfills.
- **Test coordinates (live-verified 2026-07-15):**

  | # | Expected | lat | lon | Notes |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Federal aid - Urban Other Principal Arterial | `41.9020` | `-87.6870` | Western Ave, Chicago (class 3 @ 2 ft); ACUB `Chicago, IL--IN` |
  | 2 | Non-federal aid - Urban Local | `41.9430` | `-87.7010` | Chicago residential, single class-7 |
  | 3 | Non-federal aid - Rural Local | `40.165157` | `-89.434236` | rural Logan County, class 7 @ 0 ft |

### 4.2e Ohio road classification (wired PR #36)

Source: ODOT's TIMS public ArcGIS Server (`tims.dot.state.oh.us`), the
Functional Class layer TIMS (`APP_OH`) displays. Confirmed live 2026-07-15.

- **Layer:** `https://tims.dot.state.oh.us/ags/rest/services/Roadway_Information/Functional_Class/MapServer/0`
  ("Functional Class", polyline, WKID 102100/3857 Web Mercator).
- **Class field:** `FUNCTION_CLASS_CD` (esriFieldTypeInteger) — **bare FHWA
  1-7**, confirmed by distinct values.
- **No active/retired filter needed.**
- **Route names on the same layer:** `ROUTE_TYPE` + `ROUTE_NBR` read
  cleanly for the numbered systems — `"US"/"00023"` → "US 23",
  `"SR"/"00161"` → "SR 161", `"IR"` = interstate. County/township/municipal
  codes ("MR 00923") are cryptic and skipped (`RoadNameFromBlock`'s
  `OH_ROUTE` mode); TIGER fills local street names.
- **Test coordinates (live-verified 2026-07-15):**

  | # | Expected | lat | lon | Notes |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | Federal aid - Urban Other Principal Arterial | `40.0150` | `-82.9990` | N High St / US 23, Columbus (class 3 @ 25 ft; Road Name shows "US 23 (25 ft)"); ACUB `Columbus, OH` |
  | 2 | Non-federal aid - Urban Local | `40.0855` | `-83.0170` | Columbus residential, single class-7 |
  | 3 | Non-federal aid - Rural Local | `40.320352` | `-83.302785` | rural Marion County, class 7 @ 3 ft |

#### UA / header quirks (all three)

None — all three servers answered plain GETs without a browser User-Agent
(RoadReviewer sends its browser UA regardless, harmless). Note: INDOT's
`gisdata.in.gov` showed intermittent 500s / empty responses on 2026-07-15
during this pass (recovered within minutes each time) — unrelated to these
three, but a reminder that per-row Failed + Re-run Failed Rows is the
designed recovery for state-server flakiness.

## 5. Verification plan

The user wants polished output, so verification is built into the build, not
tacked on afterwards. Every step below ends with a manual smoke test the
developer (or reviewer) actually runs in Excel before moving on.

1. **Layer discovery sanity.** Hit each MDOT REST URL in a browser; confirm
   field names; pick three known coordinates (one clearly Urban Minor
   Collector, one Rural Local inside an ACUB, one Rural Local well outside
   any ACUB). Record expected output.
2. **Skeleton workbook.** Build the Home / Setup / Sites sheets and the
   three workflow sheets. Manual check: open the workbook fresh, confirm
   every button is wired to a sub, no orphan controls.
3. **Sites table.** Wire up the hyperlink formulas and lat/lon validation.
   Manual check: paste in the three known coordinates, confirm every
   hyperlink opens the right map at the right zoom.
4. **Workflow 1 — Classify Roads.** Implement against MDOT (MI), INDOT
   (IN) and WisDOT (WI) layers. Manual check: run on each state's known
   coordinates (§4.2, §4.2a, §4.2b) and confirm class, road name,
   urban/rural, federal-aid status match expectations. Also try a point
   in Tennessee → should report "out of state" not crash.
5. **Workflow 2 — Review Imagery.** Implement the one-click open-many-tabs
   button. Manual check: click on a row, verify every URL opens to the
   correct point.
6. **Workflow 3 — FIRMettes + Maps.** Reuse the prototype's FIRMette and
   MapPages code, but driven from the consolidated Sites table.
   Manual check: batch over 5 sites, confirm 5 PDFs land in the output
   folder with correct names, confirm the combined Map PDF renders
   correctly.
7. **Re-run-failed-rows.** Simulate a failure (kill network briefly), run
   the workflow, then reconnect and click "Re-run failed". Confirm only
   the failed rows are retried.
8. **State selector.** Switch to an unwired state (MN/IL/OH), confirm
   the friendly "not yet wired" message. MI/IN/WI must NOT show it.
9. **Cold-open test.** Close the workbook, copy it to a different
   directory, reopen. Confirm all buttons still work and the macros are
   trusted by Office (this is the most common real-world failure for
   shared `.xlsm` files).
10. **Hand-off review.** Walk a non-developer co-worker through the
    workflow on a real WO. Capture friction points → version 1.0.1
    backlog.

---

## 6. Design ideas for V2+ (not in V1)

These came up reading the prototypes; capturing them so they aren't lost.

- **Auto-capture basemap for MapPages — SHIPPED (PR #35, §7e).** "Fetch
  Imagery" on the Map Pages ribbon downloads a site-centered Esri World
  Imagery aerial per page (one anonymous GET against the MapServer
  `/export` endpoint) and places it automatically; the imagery source is
  user-swappable to any ArcGIS MapServer via the Map Pages "Imagery URL"
  cell. Remaining risk from the original list: reachability of
  `services.arcgisonline.com` from a hardened govt laptop is untested.
- **Route-optimization integration.** The user has a separate route
  planner. Easiest hand-off: export the Sites table as a CSV / KML / GPX
  that the planner already accepts. Avoid tight coupling for now.

- **Rapid site-by-site review on the authoritative map (idea, PR #22).**
  The tool already exports a KML of all sites (`ExportSitesToKML`) and can
  drop it onto the user's AGOL webmap (`SendSitesToAgolMap`). Now that the
  official public functional-class app URL is known for MI/IN (and MN/IL/OH
  — see §7c / `modSources`), two follow-ons are feasible: (a) a per-row
  deep-link that opens *that state's official app* centered on the site
  (today the NFC Map column opens the FEMA Map Viewer webmap, not the DOT's
  own Experience app — the Experience Builder coordinate deep-link was
  rolled back once for mis-navigating, PR #18, so this needs care); and
  (b) publishing the Sites KML as a hosted feature layer and building an
  ArcGIS **Instant App** (e.g. Attachment Viewer / Media Map / Nearby) to
  step through each site over the authoritative class + ACUB layers. Both
  need an AGOL org + auth, so they're out of the no-auth V1 scope, but the
  verified per-state app/REST URLs are the missing piece and are now on
  file.
- **AGOL Experience Builder front-end.** For features that are awkward in
  Excel — drawing a polygon search area, side-by-side historical imagery,
  collaborative editing — we can publish the Sites table as a hosted
  feature service and build an Experience app on AGOL. The Excel
  workbook stays the *system of record* (the inspector still owns their
  spreadsheet); the AGOL view is a read-only or write-on-top layer.
  This sidesteps any limitation of "only public maps" because AGOL is
  already licensed for the user's organisation.
- **Historical Google Earth / Nearmap links** for pre-disaster imagery.
- **State expansion — DONE for Region V (PR #36).** All six states are
  wired (§4.2-§4.2e); no normalisation function was needed for MN/IL/OH
  (all bare FHWA 1-7). ACUB stays nationwide. Any future out-of-region
  state follows the same recipe: probe `?f=pjson` + `returnDistinctValues`,
  add a `QueryStateRoads` case + REST/Svc_ key, live-verify 3 coords.
- **NHS column.** Surface MDOT's NHS layer (and the equivalent in other
  states) so the inspector can see federal-aid-system status alongside
  functional class.

```

The two prototype `.xlsm` files are kept in `archive/` as references. The V1
deliverable is a new workbook so we don't drag along the VBA-stomping
warning from the Site Inspector Tool. The workbook **is committed at the
repo root** so it's accessible to inspectors who clone the repo, and is
rebuilt on the user's Windows laptop from `src/` (see
`docs/build-and-import.md`) — the cloud build environment has no Excel,
so changes to `src/` need a local rebuild + commit before the .xlsm
reflects them.

## 7a. Implementation status (V1)

Everything in the §3 V1 scope is BUILT and covered by the §9.2 verifier
suite: all six Region V states classify live (PR #36), Fetch Imagery is the
map hero (PR #35, §7e), FIRMettes/Map Pages/KML/CSV/GeoJSON all pass their
verifiers on the committed workbooks. The increment-by-increment build
narrative (increments 1-6, per-capability status table, the bugs each pass
found) is in `docs/HISTORY.md` §7a; the recurring VBA/COM traps distilled
from it live in §9.3/§9.4 below.

---

## 7b. FHWA Road Checker — public web prototype (summary)

`web/index.html` is RoadReviewer's Workflow 1 as a public static page:
client-side only (no backend/accounts/analytics; the browser queries the same
public services), paste-and-see UX, PR #24 verdict model ported 1:1, PDF
report + FIRMette ZIP + site-by-site review. rr-core (the `<script id="rr-core">`
block) is a hand-port of modClassify/modConstants — keep the two in sync by
hand; `build/verify-web-core.mjs` runs the exact shipped block against the
live services. Full design narrative + verification history:
`docs/HISTORY.md` §7b; privacy/hosting: `web/README.md`; per-state citations:
`web/sources.html`. Load-bearing gotchas:

- Experience Builder coordinate deep-links MIS-NAVIGATE (PR #17/#18): link
  official state apps at their canonical ROOT; pinned-location duty sits on
  the FEMA Map Viewer links.
- AGOL-hosted FeatureServers (IN/WI/ACUB) are Query-only — no /export or
  /legend. Figures draw each layer's published drawingInfo.renderer
  client-side (INDOT publishes single-symbol → FHWA-palette substitution,
  disclosed). WI trunk renderer keys off FC_CD, not FED_FC_CD; MnDOT's keys
  off FUNCTIONAL_CLASS_DESC.
- jsPDF must be created `compress: true` (else ~5 MB/figure); basemap tiles
  load `crossOrigin="anonymous"` against Esri's CORS tile service.
- Leaflet map is created `zoomAnimation: false` (in-flight zoom animations
  swallow the next setView).
- GitHub Pages: "Re-run all jobs" fails with duplicate github-pages
  artifacts — recover with a FRESH run, or re-run only the deploy job.

## 7c. Two-product split (2026-07-05) — summary

Two products, one `src/` tree, same three-sheet shape (§7d has the CURRENT
sheet roles). Do not relitigate the split. PR-by-PR narrative (#21-#32,
including now-OBSOLETE column orders) is in `docs/HISTORY.md` §7c.

| | RoadReviewer.xlsm (Standard) | Site Inspector Review Tool.xlsm (Inspector) |
|---|---|---|
| Audience | PDMGs, state/local partners, reviewers | FEMA PA site inspectors |
| Extra inputs | — | WO, DI, Disaster, Applicant |
| Extra buttons | — | FIRMettes, Map Pages workflow (hero) |
| Column hiding | inspector-only cols hidden (WO/DI/FIRMette+Map Status) | photo/NFC links hidden until Check Roads |

Product identity: hidden defined name `RR_Product` baked at build time
(`modUtil.SetProduct`, called by build.ps1); runtime branches via
`ProductIsInspector()` / `ProductTitle()` / `StartSheetName()`; a missing
name defaults to Inspector (superset). `COL_*` constants are SHARED — the
standard product hides inspector-only columns rather than having its own
column map, which keeps modClassify/modMaps/modExport product-agnostic. The
in-Excel "Repair Layout" button rebuilds the same product. Check Roads =
auto-geocode (Address rows without coords, never overwrites) + classify;
Re-run Failed Rows retries anything whose Federal Aid Status starts
"Failed - ". Current column order: `src/modConstants.bas` (§7f). Workbooks
filled under pre-split layouts do NOT migrate; start new work from the
current builds.

---

## 7d. Map Pages hero redesign + "Tools and Exports" (2026-07-14) — CURRENT shape

A full UI restructure of the inspector product, per user direction across one
long session. **This supersedes the §7c sheet layout for the inspector.** The
prior design is archived: tag `start-here-hero` (commit `74b1d43`) + byte-exact
workbooks in `archive/start-here-hero/`.

### Sheet roles per product

| | Inspector (`Site Inspector Review Tool.xlsm`) | Standard (`RoadReviewer.xlsm`) |
|---|---|---|
| Landing (tab 1) | **Map Pages** (visible) | **Start Here** (visible hub, unchanged role) |
| Tab 2 | Sites | Sites |
| Hidden | **"Tools and Exports"** (the old Start Here, renamed; reached via the grey "Exports & other tools →" button on Map Pages, `GoToOtherTools`; "← Back to Map Pages" = `GoToMapPages`) and Sources | **Map Pages** (opt-in: any map action calls `modMaps.ShowMapPages` and reveals it with FULL functionality) |

The hub sheet is named per product — `modUtil.StartSheetName()` returns
`SH_START` ("Start Here", standard) or `SH_TOOLS` ("Tools and Exports",
inspector); every hub lookup goes through it. The map tab is `SH_MAPPAGES` =
**"Map Pages"** (renamed from "MapPages" — verifiers with hardcoded sheet-name
literals broke once already).

### Map Pages is a PERMANENT sheet

Built by `BuildWorkbook` → `modMaps.EnsureMapPagesSheet` (it used to be created
and DELETED by `PrepareMapPages`; that lifecycle is gone). `PrepareMapPages`
rebuilds only the page blocks (`ClearMapPages`) and preserves the header band +
job values — safe to re-run. The header band (rows 1..`MAP_HEADER_ROWS`, short
rows; pages start at `MAP_FIRST_PAGE_ROW`; PrintArea starts there so the band
never prints) holds:

- the ONE-CLICK hero (2026-07-16, superseding PR #35's 3-step ribbon per
  user direction "make the three buttons a single button"): **Create Combined
  Map Pages PDF** = `CreateMapPagesPdf`, which chains `PreparePagesCore` →
  `FetchImageryCore` → `ExportMapPdfCore` with a single summary MsgBox.
  **Download FIRMettes** sits right beside it as the other primary
  deliverable. Everything else lives behind a collapsed **"Advanced
  options ▸"** ghost toggle (`ToggleMapAdvanced`; state in the toggle shape's
  AlternativeText, respected by `SetMapEditControlsVisible` when it restores
  controls after an export): the individual steps (1 Prepare Pages / 2 Fetch
  Imagery / 3 Export PDF), ghost "↻ Re-run failed imagery" / "↻ Re-stamp
  pages" / "↻ Re-run failed FIRMettes", **Create Individual Map Pages PDFs**
  (`CreateIndividualMapPagePdfs` — one PDF per site named exactly like the
  FIRMette but "… Location Map.pdf"; direct writer per page,
  `ExportOnePagePrint` fallback), the **Exports & other tools →** door
  (`GoToOtherTools`, inspector only — moved here from the top-right), and the
  labeled **manual alternative** (Export to KML + Insert Images — the Google
  Earth screenshot flow). Advanced shapes are named `MapCtrl_Adv*` and ship
  hidden;
- the job block: WO / DI / Disaster (bare number, e.g. 4882) / **State**
  (inspector only; drives classification AND the filename tag) / Applicant /
  Output Folder (optional, + Browse) / **Imagery URL (optional, PR #35)** —
  these carry the `JobWO`/`JobDI`/`JobDisaster`/
  `JobState`/`JobApplicant`/`JobOutputFolder`/`JobImagerySvc` named ranges on the inspector
  (standard keeps State/Output Folder/AGOL/buffer on Start Here; its Map Pages
  shows a read-only Output Folder mirror so the name isn't defined twice).
  Band constants moved for the new layout: `MAP_HEADER_ROWS` 20→22,
  `MAP_JOB_FIRST_ROW` 11→14;
- to the RIGHT of the job boxes, a **formula-driven stamp preview** (cols I:M,
  `StampPreviewFormula`) — a live Excel-formula replica of
  `BuildMapTextboxString` driven by the first Sites data row + the job named
  ranges (blank lines skipped via a leading-`CHAR(10)` strip), so the
  inspector sees each page's stamp as they type — with the **filename
  preview** (`="File name:  "&FirmettePreview()`, volatile) directly under it.

### Shared file-name convention (modUtil)

`JobFileStem()` = `"WO123 DI5 - DR4882MI"` → used by **every** export
(Location Map PDF, per-site FIRMettes, KML, CSV, GeoJSON), suffixed per type
(`... - Sites.kml` etc.). `DisasterTag()` composes the user's convention —
**no separators since PR #37: `DR4882IN`, not `DR-4882-IN`** — bare digits
get `DR`, typed prefixes are kept with any hyphens/spaces stripped, State
appended when set (unless already typed). All-blank job info falls back to a
`yyyy-mm-dd HHmm` stamp so repeated exports never overwrite.

### State handling

State ships **blank by default** (both products). The two state-dependent NFC
link columns (13 "NFC Layer (Map Viewer)", 15 "State NFC App") show — on the
FIRST data row only, other rows blank — a working `HYPERLINK("#JobState","Set
State →")` instead of silently defaulting to Michigan. Since PR #36
`modClassify` refuses to run with a blank State (every target row gets
"Failed - no State selected" + a prompt naming the State box) — blank no
longer silently means Michigan. The State dropdown lists all six wired states
(`STATE_LIST = "WI,IN,MI,MN,IL,OH"`); the ACUB-only path for typed
out-of-region states still works.

### Hard-won operational rules (cost real corruption TWICE)

- **Verifiers must NEVER open the committed workbook read-write. Period.**
  `Close($false)` is NOT enough — OneDrive AutoSave persists macro side
  effects the moment they happen. This bit twice: first the verifiers that
  ended `$wb.Save()`, then AGAIN on 2026-07-16 when verify-firmette-maps
  (temp-copy rule not yet applied to it) deleted the permanent Map Pages
  sheet as "cleanup" and AutoSave synced `JobWO`→`#REF!#REF!` into the
  committed inspector file. Every verifier that runs macros now COPIES the
  workbook to %TEMP% first; verify-skeleton (inspection only) opens READONLY.
  A corrupted committed workbook is repaired by a plain rebuild — the .xlsm
  is fully generated from `src/`.
- **Never delete the Map Pages sheet** (in a verifier or anywhere): it is
  permanent (§7d) and carries the JobWO/JobDI/... named ranges.

## 7e. Fetch Imagery — automatic aerial download for Map Pages (PR #35, 2026-07-15)

Map Pages no longer needs manual screenshots as its primary flow. The ribbon
hero was **1 Prepare Pages → 2 Fetch Imagery → 3 Export PDF** — since
2026-07-16 those three are chained behind the single **Create Map Pages PDF**
button and live individually under "Advanced options" (§7d/§7g); the Google
Earth screenshot path (Export to KML + Insert Images) is preserved there as
the labeled "Manual alternative" (user direction: keep it as an option, not
the hero). The **PR #34 workbooks are archived byte-exact** in
`archive/pr34-manual-screenshots/`.

**How it works (`modMapFetch.bas`):** for every map page that references a
Sites row, one anonymous GET against Esri World Imagery's MapServer
`/export` endpoint (`REST_WORLD_IMAGERY`, proved live 2026-07-14/15: HTTP
200, image/png) returns a rendered aerial for a Web-Mercator bbox centered
on the site — half-width `MAP_IMG_HALFWIDTH_M` (600 m), half-height scaled
to the page-block aspect (760:568), pixels at 2× (1520×1136) so the crop
step in `PlaceImageOnPage` is a no-op. The PNG lands in `%TEMP%`, is placed
through the existing `modMapImage` pipeline (crop-to-cover + 1 pt inset
kept), and is also copied to `<output folder>\maps\Site_<n>.png` so the
manual Insert-Images flow interoperates. Because the site is always the bbox
center, a small red **pin shape** is dropped at the geometric center of each
page, plus the Esri-required **attribution** textbox bottom-left
(`MAP_PIN_PREFIX` / `MAP_ATTR_PREFIX` — deliberately NOT the control
prefixes, so `SetMapEditControlsVisible` never hides them: they must print).
Per-row progress goes to the Map Status column with `STATUS_FAILED_PREFIX`,
and **Re-run failed imagery** retries only failed rows (FIRMette model). A
row whose coordinates went bad after Prepare is *processed and marked
Failed* (not skipped), so failures are visible and re-runnable.

**User-swappable imagery source.** The Map Pages job block has an
**"Imagery URL (optional)"** cell (`JobImagerySvc`, both products): blank =
Esri World Imagery (also overridable repo-wide via `Svc_WORLD_IMAGERY` on
Sources); paste any **ArcGIS MapServer** URL to fetch from it instead
(`ImageryServiceBase` normalizes a browser-copied URL — strips query string,
trailing slashes, trailing `/export`). Only MapServers work: the `/export`
operation doesn't exist on Query-only FeatureServers (same constraint as the
web PDF figures, §7b). With a custom source the attribution line switches to
"Imagery: <host>".

**Traps hit during this pass (all fixed, all verified):**

1. **`ShowMapPages` before the early-exits = the §7d AutoSave trap.**
   `compile-check.ps1` no-op-runs `ReRunFailedImagery` against the COMMITTED
   workbook; an unconditional `ShowMapPages` at the top of the sub unhid the
   standard product's Map Pages and OneDrive AutoSave persisted it (caught by
   verify-skeleton). Fix: reveal only after the "any pages?" check, and
   compile-check now opens READONLY.
2. **`modMapImage.ClearPlaceholderText` still used the pre-header-band row
   formula** (`pageIdx*ROWS+1`), so on pages 3+ it cleared cells INSIDE the
   header band (job-field labels) instead of the page placeholder. Latent
   since the §7d band was added; fixed to the `MAP_FIRST_PAGE_ROW` offset.
3. **`build.ps1` imports an explicit module list**, not a glob — a new .bas
   must be added there or it silently doesn't ship (compile-check catches it).
4. **The 1-site "single cell for the print area" modal.** Each map page is
   one big MERGED cell, so with exactly one site the print area is a single
   merged cell — and Excel pops "You've selected a single cell for the print
   area" on the `PageSetup.PrintArea` assignment whenever alerts are on
   (`PrepareMapPages` re-enables `DisplayAlerts` before Export runs). It hung
   every headless 1-site export (an invisible `NUIDialog` — found by
   enumerating the hidden Excel's windows via user32) and hit the user
   interactively too. OK is the right answer, so `SetMapPrintArea` now wraps
   the assignment in its own `DisplayAlerts = False` save/restore. Multi-site
   runs never showed it, which is why verify-imagery (3 sites) passed while
   verify-firmette-maps (1 site) hung.

**Layout constants moved:** `MAP_HEADER_ROWS` 18→20, `MAP_JOB_FIRST_ROW`
8→11 (the manual-alternative line sits between the ribbon and the job
block). `modHttp.HttpDownloadPdf` was generalized into `HttpDownloadBinary`
(accept header + expected Content-Type as params; PDF wrapper kept).

**Verification:** `build\verify-imagery.ps1` runs end-to-end on a %TEMP%
copy of the inspector build: 3 live sites → Prepare → one row sabotaged →
Fetch (2 placed, 1 Failed, batch continues) → sentinel + re-run-failed (only
the failed row retried) → imagery-URL override re-fetch (World_Street_Map,
attribution switches) → Export PDF → PyMuPDF asserts page count == 3,
attribution + stamp text on every page, ~90% non-white imagery coverage, and
yellow pushpin pixels just above page center (per §9.8: rendered pixels,
never `get_image_rects`). Known risk (stated in the commit): reachability of
`services.arcgisonline.com` from a hardened FEMA laptop is untested.

## 7f. UX pass: naming, output folder, columns & links (PR #37, 2026-07-15)

All per user direction, both products. Everything below is asserted by the
updated verifiers (skeleton labels/hiding, classify/rerun column indices,
DRTEST filenames) and the whole §9.2 suite passes on the rebuilt workbooks.

1. **Disaster naming**: `DR4882IN`, no hyphens, everywhere the disaster
   appears (see §7d). `DisasterTag` strips typed separators too.
2. **Output folder default**: `<workbook dir>\RR Output\` / `\SI Tool
   Output\` + the OneDrive https→local mapping + `SurfaceFolder` after
   every export (full detail in §8 resolved #9). `SetOutputFolderDefault`'s
   display formula (standard Start Here) appends `RR Output\` so the shown
   default matches. SurfaceFolder is headless-gated, so it's exercised
   only by a human click-test.
3. **AGOL column defaults to the FEMA pin**: blank `JobAgolMap` → every
   row links the FEMA-hosted Map Viewer as "FEMA AGOL Map Viewer"; a
   pasted webmap URL takes the column over as before. The separate FEMA
   Viewer column (27) ships hidden in BOTH products, as do Google Maps
   (23) and Bing (25); Street View stays visible; Google Earth keeps its
   split (inspector hidden). CSV resolver matches.
4. **Reviewer block reordered** — verdicts lead: Federal Aid Status (16/P),
   Review Reason (17/Q), then FHWA Class, Urban/Rural, ACUB Name, Road
   Name, Street Name (18-22). `COL_REVIEWER_FIRST/LAST` still span 16-22,
   so tint/hide logic was untouched; only constants + verifier indices
   moved. **Check Roads reveals the block BEFORE its loop** so the user
   watches verdicts appear row by row. *(Bug fixed test-7.16: the red/green/
   yellow **conditional-format range** was still hard-coded `COL_CLASS..
   COL_REVIEWNOTE` (cols 18→17) after this reorder, so column P — the very
   verdict column — never tinted. Now spans `COL_REVIEWER_FIRST..LAST`
   like everything else. If the reviewer block ever moves again, this CF
   range in `modBuild.ApplySitesFormatting` must move with it.)*
5. **Map-link columns sit together** (13 "NFC Layer (Map Viewer)", 14
   "State NFC App"), AGOL moved to 15. Labels are descriptive, not "Open":
   col 13 = "Review NFC AGOL Layer", col 14 = "Review State NFC Layer" —
   except **Wisconsin**, whose two links split its two layers: col 13 =
   "Review Local Roads Layer" (local-roads side-load,
   `URL_NFC_MAPVIEW_WI_LOCAL`) and col 14 = "Review State Trunk Hwy Layer"
   (the FFCL trunk side-load, coords included, replacing WisDOT's static
   -PDF app link there).
6. **Excel HYPERLINK 255-char trap** (cost a build round): the
   percent-encoded WI local-roads side-load link is ~261 chars and
   HYPERLINK() returns #VALUE! past 255. The `url=` value is deliberately
   left unencoded (~239 chars, legal — no `&` inside). Watch this on any
   future side-load of a long layer path.
7. **`docs/Region V Test Coordinates.xlsx`** — the 19 live-verified test
   points for all six states (coords + expected verdict/class/ACUB +
   sources), for hand smoke-testing without digging through CLAUDE.md.

## 7g. Direct PDF export + one-click Map Pages (2026-07-16)

Driven by the user's report that a real Location Map PDF had the screenshots
"outside the print area again". Four changes shipped together; the first is
the important one.

### 1. The Location Map PDF is now WRITTEN DIRECTLY (`modPdf.bas`) — Excel's print renderer is broken on real machines

**The discovery (measure output with PyMuPDF, never trust "looks close").**
On the dev laptop, `ExportAsFixedFormat` renders the whole page **vertically
stretched ~7%** (and ~±2% horizontally) while paginating with nominal sizes.
Proven minimal: a bare 100×100 pt square on a *fresh workbook* prints as
97.9×105.1 pt; a 405-pt block of 17-pt rows prints 434.9 pt tall. It affects
cells AND shapes, Brother driver AND Microsoft Print to PDF, interactive AND
headless COM. So every map image printed ~760×606 instead of 760×568,
bleeding to the page edge — the §9.8 work calibrated *pagination* (which is
correct) but the *render* scale was invisible until measured. Two secondary
bugs found on the way and also fixed, though neither was sufficient alone:
`PictureFormat.Crop` metadata is IGNORED by the PDF exporter (the full
uncropped bitmap prints — so crops are now baked into the pixels via WIA in
`PlaceImageOnPage`/`CropImageFileToAspect`), and `xlMoveAndSize` anchoring
let row-height drift stretch pictures (now `xlMove` + an export-time
re-snap: `NormalizeMapLayoutForPrint` → `SnapShapesToPages`).

**The fix:** `ExportMapPdfCore` first calls `modPdf.BuildMapPdfDirect`,
which writes the PDF byte-by-byte: PDF 1.4, one JPEG per page (every source
re-encoded via WIA at `JPEG_QUALITY`, downscaled to `MAP_MAX_PX_W`, embedded
as `/DCTDecode`) cover-cropped into the
760×568 block by a clip path, the stamp + attribution as REAL vector text
(base-14 Helvetica/Helvetica-Bold, WinAnsi — searchable, crisper than
printing), and the site pushpin as vector art. No printer, no page breaks,
no driver margins, no DPI — identical output on every machine.
`verify-screenshot-pdf.ps1` asserts the imagery lands at exactly
(17,23)-(776,589) on every page. The §9.8 print pipeline survives as the
FALLBACK (WIA unavailable, or a page's image source file missing) — the
image source path is remembered in each picture's AlternativeText
(`TagImageSource`; the fetch flow points it at the durable `maps\` copy).
Pages with no image (placeholder state) render as white + stamp.

**File size (2026-07-16).** Every page image is re-encoded through WIA before
embedding — downscaled to `MAP_MAX_PX_W` (1400 px, ~133 DPI across the block)
and JPEG `JPEG_QUALITY` (80) — so a manual screenshot inserted as a large JPEG
is compressed too (it used to pass through un-recompressed). This roughly
halves the PDF: a 3-page real-aerial export dropped to ~219 KB/page (~450 KB
before). Both constants live at the top of `modPdf.bas`; lower them for even
smaller files (the aerial carries no fine text — stamp/pin/attribution are
vector, so quality can go well below 80 before it shows). A source already
narrower than the cap isn't upscaled; if WIA is unavailable an already-JPEG
source still embeds as-is (uncompressed).

### 2. One-click hero + Advanced options (§7d has the layout)

"Create Map Pages PDF" (`CreateMapPagesPdf`) chains
`PreparePagesCore → FetchImageryCore → ExportMapPdfCore` (the old public
subs are thin wrappers over these cores and remain as the Advanced-options
step buttons). Everything non-primary is collapsed behind "Advanced
options ▸" per user direction — the band shows exactly two green buttons
(Create Map Pages PDF, Download FIRMettes) plus the job boxes.

### 3. Yellow Google Earth-style pushpin

`modMapFetch.AddSitePin` now builds a grouped vector pushpin (grey needle +
yellow ball + glint) whose **tip** sits exactly on the site; the old red dot
is gone (user direction). Convention: the pin group's bottom-center IS the
site point — `SnapShapesToPages` and `modPdf.PushpinOps` both rely on it.

### 4. Sites photo links (per user): Street View AND Google Earth visible in BOTH products

Google Maps (23), Bing (25), FEMA Viewer (27) stay hidden everywhere; Google
Earth (26) lost its inspector-hidden split.

## 8. Design decisions (resolved) and remaining open questions

### Resolved (do not relitigate)

1. **ACUB source — nationwide AGOL layer.** The user-provided AGOL item
   `decb7d40c3d540f484dc6925effa9d4b` is the ACUB source for **all six
   Region V states**, not just Michigan. URL and field discovery tracked
   in §4.2.
2. **Address + lat/lon.** V1 accepts both. Census Bureau Geocoder
   (`https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/onelineaddress?…`)
   converts address → lat/lon on demand. Lat/lon already in the row is
   never overwritten.
3. **Imagery workflow.** One-click multi-open: a single button on the
   Review Imagery sheet (or context-menu on a Sites row) opens 4–6
   imagery URLs in default-browser tabs for the selected row.
4. **Workbook scope.** Single consolidated `RoadReviewer.xlsm` with a
   Home sheet, one shared Sites table, and three workflow sheets.
5. **Eligibility scope — always run.** V1 has no visibility into the
   row's PA Category, so the road-class check runs on every row. The
   rule is a flag, not a gate: the inspector reads "INELIGIBLE" + class
   on the row and decides whether it applies. If Grants Manager
   integration ever lands (V2+), the check could narrow to Cat B / C /
   D / F / G — the categories that may touch federal-aid routes.
6. **NHS.** Skip in V1. Add later if needed.
7. **MapPages images.** Manual screenshot paste in V1; auto-basemap
   capture is a V2 effort (see §6).
8. **WO/DI.** Per-job only — Setup sheet drives it. Row-level override
   is allowed by editing the row's WO/DI cells directly; no mode toggle.
9. **Output folder default — superseded PR #37.** The default is now a
   product subfolder NEXT TO the workbook: `<workbook dir>\RR Output\`
   (standard) or `<workbook dir>\SI Tool Output\` (inspector), created
   on demand; an explicit Output Folder value still wins. A
   OneDrive-synced workbook reports an `https://` path — the old code
   silently fell through to the §8.9 OneDrive probe (the "outputs went
   to Desktop\Scripts\RoadReviewer" bug the user hit); `modMaps.
   OneDriveLocalFolder` now maps the URL back to the locally synced
   path via the `OneDrive*` env vars (longest-matching URL tail whose
   folder actually contains the workbook file). The §8.9 probe remains
   only for a never-saved or unmappable workbook. Every export also
   ends with `modUtil.SurfaceFolder`: the output folder is opened in
   Explorer, or its already-open window is un-minimized and raised.
   **OneDrive-for-Business / SharePoint library fix (2026-07-16).** A
   workbook synced from a *business* library ("OneDrive - FEMA") reports
   its path as a `https://<tenant>-my.sharepoint.com/.../Documents/...`
   URL, and `OneDriveLocalFolder` mangled it into
   `<base>\https:\...sharepoint.com\...\RR Output\` (a "Could not create
   the output folder" error). Cause: the first candidate tail still
   carried the `https:` scheme, `Dir$` **raised** on that malformed path,
   and under `On Error Resume Next` a raise inside a **block-`If`
   condition resumes at the first statement INSIDE the `Then`** (a VBA
   quirk) — so it returned base+full-URL instead of skipping. Fixes:
   skip any tail still containing `":"`, test existence through
   `FileExistsSafe` (self-contained error handling, can't fall through),
   and add `USERPROFILE\OneDrive*` folders to the search bases in case the
   env vars aren't set. `OneDriveLocalFolder(urlFolder, wbName)` is now
   Public + `wbName`-parameterized so `build\verify-output-folder.ps1`
   drives it against a synthetic URL + fake sync tree (asserts the clean
   local folder maps and no `https`/`sharepoint` fragment survives). The
   dev machine used a plain `C:\Users\…\OneDrive\…` local path, so this
   `http` branch was never exercised until a real SharePoint library hit
   it.

10. **MDOT NFC field names — confirmed 2026-05-22 (verification §5.1).**
    Read live from `mdotgis.state.mi.us` via the procedure in
    `docs/probe-mdot-layers.md`. Class comes from layer **353**, field
    `FunctionalSystem` (smallint, coded-value domain 0–7), filtered
    `where=RHRetireDate IS NULL`. Layer 364 is feature-type only ("RD")
    and skipped. Trunkline route name comes from layer **543**
    (`RouteDesignation`/`RouteNumber`), blank for local streets. ACUB is
    the NTAD layer's `NAME` field (native WGS84). Full schema, eligibility
    table, and three live-verified test coordinates are in §4.2.
11. **INDOT + WisDOT NFC field names — confirmed live 2026-07-01.**
    `gisdata.in.gov` and `services5.arcgis.com` are both reachable from
    this repo's cloud sandbox (unlike `mdotgis.state.mi.us`), so this
    round was verified directly rather than via the local-workstation
    probe workflow. Indiana's `functional_class` (LRSE_Functional_Class,
    layer 22) and Wisconsin's `FED_FC_CD` (state-trunk layer) both share
    Michigan's bare-FHWA-1-7-code shape with no urban/rural embedded.
    Wisconsin's local-roads fallback layer is the one exception — its
    `FNCT_CLS_CTGY_TYCD` embeds urban/rural into the code itself, handled
    by `WisconsinLocalCategoryToFhwa()` in `modConstants.bas`. Full
    schemas, eligibility mapping, and live-verified test coordinates for
    both states are in §4.2a and §4.2b.

### Still open

One cosmetic item unchanged from before: the MDOT NFC/NHS/ACUB
Experience-app marker URL parameter format (§4.3) is still TBD — only
affects the per-row "Open in map" deep link (F11), not the classification
logic. Can be pinned down during the §5.4 smoke test.

The `url=`-sideload Map Viewer links (the "Review ... Layer" columns,
§9.3b/§7f) remain **unverified in a browser** for every state: built and
reasoned through from the Map Viewer URL parameters already proven for
`URL_FEMAVIEW`, but the sideload rendering itself hasn't been click-tested.
They degrade gracefully (correct pin+zoom even if the layer overlay doesn't
render). `SurfaceFolder`'s raise-existing-Explorer-window behavior (§7f) is
likewise headless-untestable and needs a human click-test.

## 9. Developer notes — rebuild workflow and VBA gotchas

Reference material for whoever is editing `src/` next. Lookup-style; the
narrative version of how these bugs got found is in `docs/HISTORY.md` §7a.

### 9.1 Rebuild the workbooks after a `src/` change

`build\build.ps1` builds **both products by default**
(`-Product Standard|Inspector|Both`, default `Both`) into the repo root:
`RoadReviewer.xlsm` + `Site Inspector Review Tool.xlsm`. Close any open
Excel first — the files are locked while open.

```powershell
# from anywhere - builds both products
& "C:\Users\caleb\OneDrive\Desktop\Scripts\RoadReviewer\build\build.ps1"

# then commit the refreshed .xlsm files
cd "C:\Users\caleb\OneDrive\Desktop\Scripts\RoadReviewer"
git add RoadReviewer.xlsm "Site Inspector Review Tool.xlsm" <other src files>
git commit -m "Rebuild workbooks: <what changed in src/>"
git push origin main
```

The build, per product:

1. Starts a hidden Excel via COM (one instance for the whole run).
2. Imports every `.bas` from `src/` plus `build\BuildHelper.bas`.
3. Calls `SetProduct` (bakes the hidden `RR_Product` name, §7c) then
   `BuildWorkbookSafe`, which flips `gHeadless = True` and invokes
   `BuildWorkbook`. The Safe wrapper writes any error to
   `%TEMP%\RoadReviewer_build_error.txt` and re-raises so the COM host
   sees a real exception instead of Excel sitting in VBE break mode.
4. Removes `BuildHelper` from the project before save (build-time-only).
5. SaveAs into %TEMP% staging as `xlOpenXMLWorkbookMacroEnabled` (52),
   then `Copy-Item -Force` into the repo root (ACL workaround, §9.4).
6. Quits Excel cleanly after the last product.

Takes ~20s for both on a typical laptop. Use `-Product` for one product
and `-OutDir` for a different destination folder.

### 9.2 Verifier suite

Every script in `build/` flips `gHeadless` on, runs a target workflow
against a built workbook (`-XlsmPath`), and asserts results. The classify
scripts work against either product (the classify path is shared); the
FIRMette/MapPages scripts need the **inspector** build (the standard
product has no FIRMette buttons or WO/DI named ranges).

| Script | What it covers | Run against | Network? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verify-skeleton.ps1` | §5.2 + §5.3 — sheets, buttons (every OnAction resolves), product button/named-range surface, Sites headers (row 2), hidden inspector-only columns, toolbar buttons, hyperlink formulas (incl. Google Earth), lat/lon decimal validation, verdict conditional formatting, Sources content | each product | no |
| `verify-classify.ps1` | §5.4 — Check Roads against the §4.2/§4.2a/§4.2b/§4.2c-e test coords for all SIX states + an address-only auto-geocode row | standard (or either) | MDOT + INDOT + WisDOT + MnDOT + IDOT + ODOT + NTAD + Census |
| `verify-rerun-and-state.ps1` | §5.7 + §5.8 — blank State refuses ("Failed - no State selected"); typed TN gates NFC; MN classifies for real; ReRunFailedRows only retries `Failed - ` rows | standard (or either) | MDOT + MnDOT + NTAD |
| `verify-firmette-maps.ps1` | Inspector workflow 3 — DownloadFirmettes + PrepareMapPages + ExportCombinedMapPdf on one Kalamazoo site | inspector | FEMA Print FIRMette GP |
| `verify-blank-wodi.ps1` | PR #5 — empty WO/DI produces clean filenames + stamps (no dangling `WO `, ` DI`, or `WO #` line) | inspector | FEMA GP |
| `verify-screenshot-pdf.ps1` | §7g — the manual screenshot flow end-to-end with 6 synthetic GE-aspect images (Prepare → Insert → Export), PyMuPDF asserts the imagery fills EXACTLY the 760×568 block on every page and the right image is on the right page; then sabotages the sheet geometry (rows 142→152, a picture displaced/stretched) and asserts the re-export is still exact | inspector | no |
| `verify-imagery.ps1` | §7e — Fetch Imagery end-to-end: Prepare, failure path, re-run-failed-only, imagery-URL override, Export PDF, PyMuPDF pixel/text checks. Copies the workbook to %TEMP% itself. | inspector (either works) | Esri World Imagery export |
| `verify-output-folder.ps1` | §8 resolved #9 — OneDrive-for-Business / SharePoint `https://…/Documents/…` workbook path maps to the local sync folder (not a mangled `<base>\https:\…` path); builds a fake sync tree + dummy workbook, points `OneDriveCommercial` at it, asserts the clean folder maps and unmappable URLs return `""`. Opens the workbook READ-ONLY. | each product | no |

Run the whole suite from a clean state:

```powershell
$repo = "C:\Users\caleb\OneDrive\Desktop\Scripts\RoadReviewer"
& "$repo\build\build.ps1"                  # builds both products
$std = "$repo\RoadReviewer.xlsm"
$ins = "$repo\Site Inspector Review Tool.xlsm"
& "$repo\build\verify-skeleton.ps1"        -XlsmPath $std
& "$repo\build\verify-skeleton.ps1"        -XlsmPath $ins
& "$repo\build\verify-classify.ps1"        -XlsmPath $std
& "$repo\build\verify-rerun-and-state.ps1" -XlsmPath $std
& "$repo\build\verify-firmette-maps.ps1"   -XlsmPath $ins
& "$repo\build\verify-blank-wodi.ps1"      -XlsmPath $ins
```

Trace output from any verifier lands in
`%TEMP%\RoadReviewer_classify_trace.txt` (or `_w3_trace.txt` for
Workflow 3) when `SetTrace` is on — use it to see exactly which HTTP
call was in flight if a workflow hangs.

### 9.3 VBA gotchas that bit this codebase

A lookup table for the bugs we discovered the first time `BuildWorkbook`
ran in Excel. Each one is also called out at its fix site in `src/`.

**`Worksheet.DisplayGridlines` doesn't exist.** Gridlines are a `Window`
property, not a `Worksheet` property. Use `HideGridlines(ws)` in modBuild,
which activates the sheet and flips `ActiveWindow.DisplayGridlines` with
`On Error Resume Next` for the headless-COM case where `ActiveWindow`
is `Nothing`.

**Module-level `Public` declarations must precede every Sub.** VBA throws
*"Only comments may appear after End Sub"* if you put `Public foo As
String` between two procedure bodies. All Public state lives at the top
of `modUtil`.

**`global` is a VBA reserved word** (synonym for `Public`). Using it as a
parameter name (`Private Function NewRegex(..., ByVal global As Boolean)`)
imports clean, then JIT compilation at first call throws *"Sub or
Function not defined"* on every caller. The function is renamed to
`isGlobal`.

**`line` is also reserved.** Used by `Line Input #` and the `Line`
method on Shape. Same JIT-failure pattern. `TraceLine` takes
`ByVal txt As String`, not `ByVal line As String`.

**A single-line `If` can use `Else` but NOT `ElseIf`.**
`If t < 0 Then t = 0 ElseIf t > 1 Then t = 1` is a compile "Syntax error";
split it into two single-line `If`s or a multi-line `If ... ElseIf ... End
If` block. Bit `PointSegDistM` (PR #24). Like the mid-module-declaration and
reserved-word traps, this only surfaces when the *module* is compiled, which
the build didn't force until `build\compile-check.ps1` was added (§9.1).

**ArcGIS JSON has case-sensitive attribute keys.** Default
`NewRegex(..., ignoreCase:=False)`. A case-insensitive
`FirstString("NAME")` matches the lower-case `"name":"OBJECTID"` field-
metadata entry before the actual `"NAME":"Kalamazoo, MI"` attribute,
breaking the ACUB-name column.

**MDOT requires a browser User-Agent.** `mdotgis.state.mi.us` returns
HTTP 403 to the default `MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP` UA. All HTTP traffic
goes through `HttpGetText` / `HttpDownloadPdf` in `modHttp`, which set
a Chrome-style UA via `BROWSER_UA`. NTAD ACUB (`services.arcgis.com`)
doesn't need it.

**`Application.Run` from COM can't assign module-level variables.** It
only invokes named Subs. That's why `gHeadless` and `gTracePath` have
explicit setter Subs (`SetHeadless` / `SetTrace`) the host calls by
name.

**`MsgBox` blocks `Application.Run` from COM.** With Excel hidden, a
MsgBox appears in the hidden VBE window and the COM call never
returns. Every public workflow Sub checks `gHeadless` before showing
a MsgBox; verifier scripts set it via `Application.Run "SetHeadless",
$true` before kicking off work. Cell + StatusBar state stay so
results are still observable when headless.

### 9.3a AGOL Map column + Send-to-AGOL workflow

The Sites table has **two** ArcGIS Online links per row:

1. **NFC layer links** (cols 13 `COL_NFCAGOL` + 14 `COL_NFCMAP` since the
   PR #37 reorder) — state-aware (§9.3b), with descriptive labels
   ("Review NFC AGOL Layer" / "Review State NFC Layer"; Wisconsin splits
   into local-roads / state-trunk layer links, §7f). MI's primary link
   opens the FEMA-hosted NFC/ACUB webmap
   (`webmap=6a1702b9147243d1a5ee62cd614bc681` on `fema.maps.arcgis.com`)
   centered + markered on the row's coords — the MDOT Experience app's
   popup chrome blocked click-through, so the FEMA webmap replaced it.

2. **AGOL Map** (col 15 `COL_AGOLMAP` since PR #37) — driven by the
   `JobAgolMap` cell. When the user pastes their own AGOL webmap URL,
   every Sites row deep-links into it centered + markered on the row;
   when blank it defaults to the FEMA Map Viewer pin labeled
   "FEMA AGOL Map Viewer" (§7f).

The URL-stitching formula auto-detects whether the pasted URL already
has a `?` (most AGOL share URLs do, e.g.
`https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=<id>`) and
uses `&` or `?` accordingly.

To push the *whole site set* into the inspector's AGOL webmap, the
Maps sheet has a **Send Sites to AGOL Map (KML + open webmap)**
button. It writes `RoadReviewer Sites.kml` into the output folder,
opens the AGOL webmap in the default browser, and pops Explorer with
the KML highlighted so it's a single drag-drop into the Map Viewer
window. AGOL ingests the KML as a hosted-feature layer. (V2 could
push directly via the AGOL REST API, but that needs auth and is
out of V1 scope per §3.3.)

### 9.3b State-aware NFC Map column

The NFC Map column formula (`modBuild.SetNfcMapFormula`) and the CSV
export's equivalent resolver (`modExport.NfcMapUrlForRow` - the two
must be kept in sync by hand, there's no shared helper across the
formula-string world and the plain-VBA-string world) both branch on
Setup's `JobState` cell:

- **MI** → `URL_NFC_MAPVIEW`, the curated FEMA-hosted webmap described
  in §9.3a.
- **IN/WI/MN/IL/OH** → `URL_NFC_MAPVIEW_IN/_WI/_MN/_IL/_OH` - side-load
  the state's own live NFC layer (§4.2a-§4.2e) via the Map
  Viewer's `url=` parameter, using the same `find=`/`marker=`/`level=`
  parameters already proven to work for `URL_FEMAVIEW` (rather than the
  `webmap=`+`center=` combination MI's link uses, which broke once
  before when a `visibleLayers` param was added - see the `URL_NFC_MAPVIEW`
  comment in `modConstants.bas`). No curated combined NFC+ACUB webmap
  exists for these states to point at instead. MN/IL/OH are MapServer
  (not FeatureServer) layers, which `url=` also accepts.
- **Anything else** → `URL_FEMAVIEW`, the plain pin+zoom with no data
  layer. A BLANK State cell shows the "Set State →" prompt in the cells
  (and `ClassifyRows` refuses to run, PR #36); the CSV export's resolver
  still falls back to MI links for that edge case only.

**Not yet click-tested.** The `url=`-sideload URLs were built by
reasoning from a working pattern (`URL_FEMAVIEW`) and the ArcGIS REST
`url=` parameter's documented behavior, not by opening them in a
browser - this repo's cloud sandbox can't drive a JS single-page map
app. Worst case if the layer overlay doesn't render: the link still
opens to the correct pin+zoom, just without the NFC layer on top, so
this degrades gracefully rather than breaking. Confirm the layer
actually renders during the next local smoke pass.

### 9.4 Excel / COM / PowerShell quirks

**The repo's `build\` folder AND the repo root have `Everyone Deny
DeleteSubdirectoriesAndFiles`** (Claude Code sandbox guard). Excel's
SaveAs writes to a temp file in the destination dir, then deletes the
existing destination and renames — the delete step is blocked, which
killed direct `SaveAs` to either path on overwrite. `build\build.ps1`
sidesteps it: SaveAs lands in `%TEMP%\rr-build-<guid>.xlsm` (always
writable), then `Copy-Item -Force` overwrites the OutPath without
needing delete permission on the parent dir. The committed
`RoadReviewer.xlsm` lives at the repo root so inspectors can
double-click straight after `git pull`.

**PowerShell COM late-binding sometimes picks the wrong overload of
`Range.Value`.** Setting a cell value via `$cell.Value = $someDouble`
can throw *"Unable to cast object of type 'System.Double' to type
'System.String'"*. Use `.Value2` with explicit casts:
`$sites.Cells(2, 6).Value2 = [double]$lat`.

**Mark-of-the-Web on a committed `.xlsm`.** OneDrive sometimes adds
the MoW zone after a sync, which makes Office disable macros on
first open. Fix per file: right-click → **Properties** → tick
**Unblock** at the bottom → **OK** → reopen → click **Enable
Content** on the yellow bar.

### 9.5 Blank-WO/DI handling (PR #5)

Setup's WO and DI are **not required**. Every site that emits them
in a filename, folder path, or textbox stamp routes through
`modUtil.JobIds(wo, di, sep, woPrefix, diPrefix)`, which drops the
blank piece and only inserts the separator between two present
pieces:

| Call site | Separator | Prefixes | Both blank → |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FirmetteFileName` | `" "` | `WO` / `DI` | piece omitted |
| `ExportCombinedMapPdf` filename | `" "` | `WO` / `DI` | piece omitted |
| `DefaultOutputFolder` segment | `"-"` | `WO` / `DI` | folder segment skipped |
| `BuildMapTextboxString` first line | `" "` | `WO #` / `DI #` | line skipped entirely |

A row's own WO/DI cells (Sites cols A/B) take precedence over the
Setup values for that row, which is the per-row override path noted
in F14.

### 9.6 Useful trace switches

```vba
' From the VBE Immediate window, to start writing every HTTP call to a file:
SetTrace Environ$("TEMP") & "\rr_trace.txt"
' Then run any workflow. Lines look like:
'   11:43:06 HTTP GET https://...
'   11:43:07   -> 200 (697 bytes)
'   11:43:07 ClassifyOneRow row=2 name=...
' Turn it off:
SetTrace ""
```

`gHeadless` can be flipped the same way:

```vba
SetHeadless True    ' suppress every workflow's MsgBox
SetHeadless False   ' restore default
```

### 9.7 Service-URL overrides — the "lego swapout" (PR "WI layer swap")

Every REST endpoint the classifier queries can be re-pointed at runtime,
no code change and no rebuild, so a state moving or locking a layer (as
WisDOT just did to its local-roads service) is a paste-in-a-URL fix
instead of a code edit + rebuild + redeploy. The **same short KEY names**
are used in all four products so a swap is the same mental model
everywhere:

| Key | Default constant / REST entry |
|---|---|
| `MI_NFC` / `MI_ROUTE` | MDOT 353 / 543 |
| `IN_NFC` / `IN_ROADNAME` | INDOT LRSE 22 / centerlines 15 |
| `WI_LOCAL_ROADS` / `WI_STATE_TRUNK` | WisDOT local (queried first) / state-trunk |
| `ACUB` | NTAD Adjusted Urban Areas |
| `TIGER_ROADS` | Census TIGERweb local roads |
| `MN_NFC` / `IL_NFC` / `OH_NFC` | reference-only (unwired) |

- **Excel:** `modConstants.ServiceUrl(key)` returns the value pasted into
  the Sources sheet's "3. SERVICE URLs" table (workbook named range
  `Svc_<KEY>`, built by `modSources.SvcOverrideRow`) or the built-in
  `ServiceDefault(key)` when the cell is blank. Every `REST_*` usage in
  `modClassify` now goes through `ServiceUrl()`. Keep `ServiceDefault`,
  `SvcOverrideRow`'s row list, and the web/notebook default tables in
  sync.
- **Web:** rr-core defines `svc(key)` = `globalThis.RR_SERVICE_OVERRIDES[key]
  || REST[key]`; every `REST.X` read became `svc("X")`. A shared,
  byte-identical `<script>` block on **index.html** and **sources.html**
  (`#services`) loads pasted URLs from `localStorage["rr_service_overrides"]`
  into `globalThis.RR_SERVICE_OVERRIDES` and renders the editable table.
  rr-core stays self-contained/headless-safe (the override global is
  optional; `verify-web-core.mjs` never sets it, so it exercises
  defaults). NOTE: the two REST keys were renamed `MDOT_NFC`→`MI_NFC`,
  `MDOT_ROUTE`→`MI_ROUTE` to match the Excel/notebook key vocabulary.
- **Notebook:** `SERVICE_OVERRIDES` dict + `svc(key)`; same key names.
- **Scope:** overrides cover the classification *query* endpoints only,
  not the Map-Viewer deep-link templates (`URL_NFC_MAPVIEW*`) or the
  FIRMette GP service.

### 9.8 Map-page PDF export — Excel printable-area geometry (2026-07-14)

> **2026-07-16 — this whole pipeline is now the FALLBACK.** The Location Map
> PDF is written directly by `modPdf.bas` (§7g) because Excel's print
> RENDERER (as distinct from its paginator, which everything below concerns)
> was measured drawing the whole page vertically stretched ~7% on a real
> machine — no geometry below can fix that. Everything below stays true and
> load-bearing for the fallback path (WIA missing / image source file gone).

The "40 pages for 10 sites" / "images in slivers" / "giant whitespace" family
of bugs all trace to ONE fact, plus a stack of Excel quirks discovered while
fixing it. Recorded here because it is completely non-obvious and we may
revisit (e.g. if a FEMA laptop lacks Microsoft Print to PDF).

**The fact:** Excel paginates against the ACTIVE PRINTER's *usable area* =
paper − max(page-setup margin, driver hard margin) per side — even for
`ExportAsFixedFormat` PDF export, where no paper exists. Drivers reserve far
more than you'd guess, and it varies per machine:

| Driver (landscape Letter 792×612, margins 0) | measured usable |
|---|---|
| Brother HL-L2420DW (WSD) | 749 × 552 pt |
| **Microsoft Print to PDF** (Windows inbox) | **769.5 × 576 pt** |

Content ≥ usable is auto-split onto overflow pages (a 792×612 block became a
2×2 four-page tile). **Equality also loses** — device-unit rounding tips a
block sized exactly to the usable area over the edge, so strict slack is
mandatory. And **fit-to-page scaling is NOT a fix**: it silently discards the
manual `HPageBreaks` and reflows all blocks as one continuous ~80% strip
floating in whitespace (the symptom the user caught in a real export).

**The fix (modMaps.ExportCombinedMapPdf + modConstants):**

1. Blocks are sized to Microsoft Print to PDF's floor — `MAP_PAGE_WIDTH_PTS
   = 760`, `MAP_PAGE_HEIGHT_PTS = 568` (4 rows × 142pt) — strictly under
   769.5×576. Margins 0 + `CenterHorizontally/Vertically` leave a 16pt side /
   22pt top-bottom frame. (True borderless is impossible: every driver,
   including MS PDF, reserves an edge.)
2. The export **temporarily switches `Application.ActivePrinter` to
   "Microsoft Print to PDF"** so the pagination uses that machine-constant
   inbox driver, then restores the user's printer (also on the Fail path).
   Port resolution: read `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\
   Devices\Microsoft Print to PDF` → `"winspool,Ne0X:"` → `"Microsoft Print
   to PDF on Ne0X:"`; probing Ne00..Ne31 is only the fallback (port numbers
   shuffle between sessions — a hardcoded Ne00 worked once by luck).
3. Excel traps hit on the way (each cost a debugging round):
   - `ActivePrinter` **cannot be set when no workbook is open** (a probe
     doing so silently kept the old printer and mismeasured).
   - **Switching printers resets the sheet's page setup** — orientation
     flipped back to portrait. `ConfigureMapPageSetup` + `SetMapPrintArea`
     must re-run AFTER the switch, before export.
   - `modMapImage.PageTopPts` must compute page tops with the same
     `MAP_FIRST_PAGE_ROW` offset as `modMaps.CreateMapPage` — when the
     header band moved pages down, the stale formula piled every inserted
     image at the top of the sheet, overlapping (each printed page showed
     slivers of several screenshots).
   - `IMG_INSET_PTS = 1`: a picture ending exactly ON a page-break line gets
     tipped onto an overflow page by rounding (12 pages for 6 sites — full
     page + sliver page alternating).
4. Fallback when MS Print to PDF is absent (it's a removable Windows
   feature): `FitToPagesWide=1 / FitToPagesTall=MapPageCount` — right page
   count, shrunken content with whitespace; better than a spill.

**The measurement technique (re-run this if pages ever split again):** build a
probe sheet — 200 rows × 6pt with a value in each, 50 narrow columns, target
page setup, desired printer active — and read `ws.HPageBreaks(1).Location.Row`
/ `ws.VPageBreaks(1).Location.Column`. (rows−1)×6pt = the driver's true usable
height; likewise width. That is the ceiling any block must stay strictly under.

**Verification done:** end-to-end with the user's six real Google Earth
screenshots on a copy of the built inspector — `PrepareMapPages` →
`InsertMapImages` → `ExportCombinedMapPdf` produced exactly 6 PDF pages, one
near-full-bleed image per page, stamp on top, default printer restored after.
Page counts and placements checked with PyMuPDF (`fitz`); note
`page.get_image_rects()` returns the **uncropped** image extents, which
mislead — trust page count + rendered pixels, not those rects.
